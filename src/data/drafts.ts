      "@Trevor: 87%\n@brendanmwagner: 85%\nMe: 86%\n\nAs you may have noticed by now, we decided to divide these reviews by character (more or less), so I'm back with the sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger, titled Captain America: The Winter Soldier. If you haven't seen any of the other Marvel reviews, I'd make sure to check out the review of Captain America: The First Avenger, as well as the review of The Avengers, as both of those films are relevant to this one. Right of the bat, you may have noticed that all 3 of us had very similar opinions as to how good this one was, and the consensus was that it was one of the best in the MCU lineup. Looking back, this makes sense, as this was the first one to be directed by the Russo brothers. Since all of these MCU films build off each other, I like to dive a little deeper into the plot than I typically do on most reviews.\n\nAfter the events of The Avengers, Captain America has been working under Nick Fury at S.H.I.E.L.D. He's also been working with a team of elite agents, including Black Widow and Agent Rumlow (soon to be Crossbones, but we'll get to this in a future review). Nick Fury is super sus that S.H.I.E.L.D. has been compromised, and he even ends up faking his own death to get to safety. In the scene where Fury is believed to be dead, Cap encounters an assassin with a metal arm; Black Widow tells Cap about the legend of the Winter Soldier. Now with Cap and Black Widow on the run from S.H.I.E.L.D., it is revealed that S.H.I.E.L.D. has been infiltrated very deeply by Hydra (yeah the Nazi weapons division from the first movie who we thought were all gone). Trusting nobody, Cap turns to someone who he knows can help Sam Wilson (aka Falcon) who Cap would always run with in the morning. The 3 of them are then engaged by the Winter Soldier and his Hydra team, and after Cap rips off the Winter Soldier's mask, we learn that the Winter Soldier is Bucky (Cap's best friend who fell off the train to his supposed death back in the 1940s). After escaping the battle, the team returns to Fury and devises a plan to stop Hydra/S.H.I.E.L.D. from killing millions of innocent people that they deem as potential threats. The finale of the movie has an epic battle where the mission is to destroy the helicarriers before they can do any harm. As expected, we have a final showdown between Cap and brainwashed Bucky, which results in Cap letting Bucky defeat him, only to have Bucky drag Cap out of the Potomac River, saving his life. So to recap, all of S.H.I.E.L.D. falls, Cap makes a new friend, and Bucky is still alive, but his whereabouts are unknown.\n\nThe reason why I rated this one a lot better than its predecessor is that it did the action better, it was way more thrilling to watch than the first one. One example is the scene where Nick Fury gets attacked by a bunch of Hydra agents disguised as cops and escapes by using a minigun with assistance from a plasma cutting torch. It was such an epic scene and one of my favorites of the film. The introduction of Falcon is also a great bonus, as I really enjoy his character. I think this is the MCU movie that could most easily be classified as a thriller; I don't think many of the others had this much suspense tied into it. Besides the battle of the helicarriers at the end, it doesn't have any of those super large scale battles where The Avengers fight aliens or evil robots or whatever, but I really don't think this needs anything like that. In my mind, this one was very similar to a spy-thriller-type movie.\n\nSo yeah, this definitely stacks up as one of my favorite MCU films, definitely in the top 3. As always, stay tuned for the rest of the MCU reviews, and if you haven't seen any of the last ones, make sure to go check them out! @brendanmwagner is up next with Guardians of the Galaxy (my personal favorite MCU film), so make sure to keep an eye out for that!",
