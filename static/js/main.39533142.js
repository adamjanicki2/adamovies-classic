Nolan is my favorite film director by far, and I truly believe that comparing his movies is one of the most difficult tasks. If I was forced to say where Inception falls on this scale, I put it at #2, ahead of The Dark Knight Rises, and behind Interstellar (which is my favorite movie period). This is one of those films that has an all-star cast. We have Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, and Ken Watanabe back for yet another Nolan film, along with Nolan-newcomers Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon Levitt (who hadn't yet appeared in The Dark Knight Rises), and Ellen Page. \n\nI'm now going to talk about why I gave this a 97%. There are 3 main reasons: the score, the story, and the ending. Let's start by getting obvious out of the way. Zimmer is my favorite composer ever, with \"Time\" being the best single track from any movie in my opinion. In addition to just sounding beautiful, the harmony the soundtrack has with the story and plot matches perfectly. Next, the story. This is a component that Nolan has always nailed, sticking to a story throughout the movie, and keeping the audience invested in that story. We find out almost immediately that Cobb is trying to get back to his family, and this plot point motivates all of his actions throughout the movie. And last but not least, the ending: Nolan and his ambiguous endings. We either love them or hate them, and I for one love them. It was truly a beautiful ending, with the family reunion in perfect sync with Zimmer's \"Time.\" That's it for my brief review!

The first thing that I'd like to mention is how sorry I feel for this movie. This is a great movie, it just doesn't seem like it when compared with either of its successors. The only thing that most non-die-hard Nolan/Batman fans will remember was Heath Ledger's Joker performance (and with good reason), so this film always gets over-shadowed. So what makes this film great? I think it's the best origin story film ever. Nolan devotes the entire first 1/3 to 1/2 of the film on Batman's origins, so it's no wonder this aspect shines through. \n\nAlso, this was the first time the greatest director-composer duo of Nolan and Zimmer worked together (although an argument could be made for the Spielberg-Williams duo in 1975, 1981, & 1993; comment down below if you know which films I'm referencing). I'll admit, this isn't Zimmer's best work, as it won't stand up to the likes of his work on Inception & Interstellar in my opinion, but it still had some nice tracks, not to mention that all the tracks where creatively named after different bat species. The reason why this ranks lower than either of the following movies in the trilogy is that due to its 2:45 run time, it's a little bit lacking in some places, especially when compared to the Dark Knight.

Episode 4 was awesome because we had many of our questions answered, but two looming questions still remain: why is Wanda in this alternate reality?

Nolan has truly mastered the art of SFX, this was the best theater-going experience I've had in my life. The big question is where does this movie fit in with other Nolan films? This is my 3rd Nolan review, and as I mentioned last time, I absolutely hate comparing his movies; it's an impossible task! I'm going to have to put it at position 3. behind Interstellar and Inception, and ahead of The Dark Knight Rises. This film had some of the most mind-blowing moments of any Nolan film. Yes, you heard me correctly: Tenet is significantly more mind-blowing and confusing than the likes of Memento, The Prestige, and Inception (I'm still debating whether Interstellar's big reveal is more or less mind-blowing than some Tenet moments). \n\nThere's no other way to describe this movie than Nolanesque: he leverages time to create a gorgeous plotline and story. No matter how many times Nolan uses the time to form a story, it never gets old. I mean just try and think how many times he's used time as a central backbone to his films! John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, and Elizabeth Debicki are on the top of their game throughout the entire film, creating some incredible scenes. There is only one slightly negative thing I have to say about the movie: the absence of Hans Zimmer. Don't get me wrong, I think Ludwig G\xf6ransson is an awesome composer (I'm a huge fan of The Mandalorian soundtrack), but I just think Zimmer is better, and he knows exactly how to work with Nolan, as the dynamic duo have teamed up for the majority of Nolan's films. I highly highly recommend giving this one a watch (ok perhaps several watches). I know a lot of people haven't seen this since it's new, so I tried to not talk too much about the plot. As always, leave your own thoughts down below!\n\nEDIT (2/25/21): Just finished watching Tenet for the second time, and I HIGHLY recommend that everyone watches this film as many times as possible. There were so many new things I was able to catch, like the red tag on the agent\u2019s bag in the opening opera scene, Neil knowing exactly what drink to get for The Protagonist, the shipping crate marked with \u201cTallinn\u201d in the Oslo Freeport, I could go on and on. The profoundness of the time inversion is really what makes this film so incredible; especially with how the inversion makes for a beautiful (bittersweet) ending to a mind-blowing adventure.

One of the major plot points throughout the entire season is the fact that Walt's brother-in-law, Hank, is a DEA Agent, a plot point that is very essential to the whole story. As Walt and Jesse get more ambitious with their endeavor to profit, they go into business with a local drug kingpin, Tuco Salamanca. Season 1 ends with Hank and Jesse scared for their lives after seeing how dangerous Tuco is. \n\nI think so far this is a good show, there was great character development, and even more critical, the motivation of our main characters is interesting, which makes it easy to keep watching the show. One thing I will note about this show, and I'll probably touch on this again in the future, is that there's a lot of unnecessary drama in the show that I really don't care for. I started watching this show after hearing that they melted bodies with hydrofluoric acid. Each episode is ~48 minutes long, and I probably end up skipping 5-10 minutes of the episode because I really don't care about seeing the drama. That's the main reason I only have this first season an 80%. Whether you agree or disagree with me, let me know in the comments down below.

Three of my favorite characters in the entire show, Jane Margolis, Saul Goodman, and Gus Fring are introduced, and also the intensity of the show as a whole is taken up a notch. Poor Jesse though. Season 2 is really just the beginning of a long line of unfortunate events for Jesse. Walt's desperation for money is really shown in the season, and his willingness to do whatever it takes to earn money is really on display. Walt is still somewhat denying that he's a criminal, but we can see that he's on the path to accepting what he is. Walt's cancer is at its worst in season 2, and we really see the effect on both him and his family. Walt continues to have difficulty hiding his illicit activities from his family, as one time he even has a marathon cook session with Jesse for multiple days. The supporting characters are what really made this season for me. \n\nThe introduction of Jane Margolis and Saul Goodman for the majority of the season was awesome to have, and Gus Fring was introduced in the final moments of the season. The last 3 episodes of season 2 are in my opinion some of the best of the entire series. Having eliminated Tuco Salamanca earlier in the season, Saul connects Walt with a mysterious and elusive mass-meth-distributor, which turns out to be Gus Fring. Walt and Jesse's dealings with Fring set in motion the entirety of seasons 3 and 4. Season 2 ends with an enormous accident, one that is teased in the cold opens for the entire season, which is caused by the death of a side character whom I will not name.

Gus offers Walt a deal: $3M for 3 months of work in his meth lab. Walt initially declines, claiming that he isn't a criminal, but eventually accepts.

I won't spoil what happens in the season 3 finale, but let me say that it is wild! This season does a great job at picking right up where season 2 left off, and it has the feel like Walt and Jesse are now in the \"big leagues,\" as they're now operating out of a multi-million dollar underground lab.

I thought season 4 was awesome, and the reason why was plain and simple: there was so much action. We start the season off with Gus slitting Victor's throat with a box cutter, then mid-season we get the awesome storyline in Mexico, where Gus poisons all of the cartel, and we end with the most creatively named episode of the season \"Faceoff\", where Gus has half his face, and body, blown off my an explosive detonated by Hector Salamanca. This season really delivered the action that I wanted out of the show, which is why I'm giving it more praise than season 3. Another thing I liked about this season is Skyler being much much less annoying. \n\nWhen Skyler is working with Saul and laundering the money, I think it was the most I've liked her all season. Also, she was causing a little less drama than usual (completely opposite of season 5), so I ended up skipping over less of each episode which was a plus. There was even a plot twist in the last 15 seconds of the season where we find out that it was Walt who poisoned Brock Cantillo. This was a huge plot twist that I totally wasn't expecting! When Walt convinced Jesse to help him kill Gus, I believed Walt when he said that it was Gus who poisoned Brock. Season 4 is when Walter really starts to get more willing to commit acts of violence, as we see him poison a small kid to get Jesse to help him kill Gus, and he's also willing to blow up a bomb in a retirement home in order to kill Gus.

Just like the last episode, we learn a lot more about what's actually happening, as we see footage of Wanda stealing Vision's corpse from S.W.O.R.D. HQ. So where stand as of right now is Wanda is holding the entire town capture, and controlling each of them to do what she wants for the sitcom. Currently, it appears as though this is all her choice; in earlier reviews, I was speculating that something or someone might be forcing her to do this, but as of now it seems she has created this sitcom world to have a family with Vision. So now one of the big questions that I still have is if Vision is resurrected in some form in real life, or if he only exists in the Hex (the Hex is was Darcy named Wanda's magic bubble that contains the sitcom). \n\nAs we've been seeing for the last couple of episodes, Vision is starting to become aware that everything around him isn't real. At the very end of the episode, Wanda and Vision are having an argument when Vision suddenly becomes aware that he has no memory of anything prior to Westfield. Another big moment comes in the final minute of the episode when there's a knock on the door, and we see Wanda open the door with a shocked face. The shot then cuts back to the real world, so we have a little time to speculate who would leave Wanda so shocked to see, and you guessed it, it's Pietro aka Quicksilver. But wait! It's not Quicksilver from Avengers: Age of Ultron, it's the most recent Quicksilver from X-men! So this leaves the big question of what does this cameo mean for the future of the MCU?

Season 5 truly felt like 2 seasons: it had 16 episodes (3 more than usual) and interestingly enough they split the season over two years, with the first 8 episodes arriving in 2012, and the second 8 arriving in 2013. Apparently, this was done at Vince Gilligan's request to have more time to produce the awesome ending to this show. And boy did he deliver. Basically, we begin the season in the aftermath of the Fring assassination, with Walt and Jesse forming a new partnership with Mike. They're all raking in a ton of money, but then things go south for the entire rest of the season. Early on, one of my favorite episodes of the entire show occurs, when Walt, Jesse, Mike, and Todd (with Lydia's help) rob 1000 gallons of methylamine off a train. There are just too many things happening in this season for me to summarize it, so instead I'm just going to go over the crazy stuff that goes down throughout the entire season.\n\nThere are a bunch of kills in this season. To start things off, Walt kills Mike, and with Mike out of the picture, Walt also puts hits on all of Mike's dozen men in jail and has them all knifed. Walt makes a huge mistake by leaving the poem book gifted to him by Gale in his bathroom, and of course, who else stumbles across the book but Hank. I mean we all knew the series would have to end with Hank discovering Walt's secret though. The last 3 episodes are undoubtedly the most insane of the entire show. After finding out that Walt poisoned Brock, Jesse works with Hank to bring Walt down. Hank and Jesse\u2019s plan leads them straight to Walt, but Walt calls for backup and Hank and Steve Gomez are gunned down by the gang that Walt called. Upon leaving the scene Walt FINALLY revealed to Jesse that he watched Jane die in season 2. I can\u2019t believe they saved that one for 3 whole seasons. Walt disappears to New Hampshire and comes back in the series finale to kill the gang and free Jesse from their clutches. Walt gets shot by a bullet from his own auto-turret, but Jesse is unharmed. The ricin from season 2 is FINALLY used when Walt calls Lydia to tell her he poisoned her with ricin when the met recently. We knew that that ricin had to be used at some point, but it\u2019s crazy how long it took. Anyways, Jesse escapes, and Walt dies of the gunshot wound.\n\nI thought this was a tremendous season to wrap everything up.

I'm gonna give a big warning upfront that this is going to be a LONG review (it's exactly 1000 words); this is my favorite movie, show, or anything that I've watched. Ever. This is the Mona Lisa of all Sci-fi films. Wait a second, I've seen the Mona Lisa in real life, and its beauty isn't a hundredth of that of Nolan's masterpiece. What I meant to say was this is pure sci-fi perfection. This is the only review that will ever get a 100% from me, although some of Nolan's other films got close. I guess to be organized I'm going to break this up into 3 sections which correspond to the 3 main reasons why I think this is the best movie ever created: the score, the concept, and the ending.\n\nTHE SCORE: As a whole, Interstellar's soundtrack is not only Zimmer's best work but also the best movie soundtrack ever created. I would add that Zimmer's \"Time\" from the Inception soundtrack is the greatest single track of all time, but looking at all the tracks as a whole, Interstellar wins any day of the week. Interstellar's soundtrack is one of the most unique soundtracks ever created, known for its big, beautiful organ-like sound. In fact, Zimmer actually went to Temple Church in London, an 800+ year old church, in order to record the organ parts of each of the tracks. The futuristic organ sound really contributes to the reason why this soundtrack sounds perfect, but not only does the soundtrack sound perfect, but Zimmer and Nolan also intentionally intertwined the score with the story. What do I mean by that? Well, perhaps the biggest theme in the entire movie is time (as with basically every Nolan film). Specifically, on some planets that Cooper and Brand visit, time relative to earth goes by much much faster, creating a lot of anxiety for the characters not to waste a single second on these planets. In order to make the audience feel this anxiety, Zimmer ingeniously places a small yet noticeable \"ticking\" sound in the background of a few of the tracks (\"Mountains\", \"Tick-Tock\", \"No Time For Caution\"). These ticks happen at a tempo of 48BPM. Now I'm not going to do the math, but 48BPM was chosen intentionally because each tick roughly represents one day on earth passing. If you don't believe me in how incredibly smart and cool this is, go listen to \"Mountains\" on youtube, and you'll see what I mean by Zimmer trying to make you feel the anxiety that our protagonists did. That's why I truly believe this was the most beautiful and ingenious movie soundtrack ever created.\n\nTHE CONCEPT: the main idea of Interstellar is what I believe makes this the deepest and most beautiful film I've had the pleasure of watching. At the core, the idea is that earth is so altered by climate change, and it is about to become uninhabitable by humans, so a crew of astronauts ventures outside of the solar system in search of the new earth. The other issue being faced by the crew is the protagonist, Coop, has a young daughter that he's trying to get back to, and outside the solar system, there are some planets where time dilation causes time relative to earth to be significantly accelerated, so the crew is not only trying to find a second earth, but they're racing to do it because they have a time limit to save the people on earth, and also get back to see their loved ones. It's such an incredible story because, for one thing, it doesn't seem that unrealistic! It's not like they're trying to save the planet from aliens, they're trying to save it from irreversible climate change, which is much more real, and provides for a higher connection with the audience. Second, the time dilation concept adds emotion and depth to the story. It lets us know that there's a deadline to complete the mission, which retains our attention through the entire journey through space and time. Both of these two factors combine to form the backbone of the story of this film, and I really can't describe in words how interesting this main concept makes the entire story.\n\nTHE ENDING: As many of you may have realized by now, I absolutely love a good movie ending. I think it's so important for me to have a good ending because I love feeling wrapped up by the end of it. To me, truly good movies are marked by endings that make me not want a sequel: endings so good that a sequel would absolutely ruin the beauty of the film. Interstellar had one of the most beautiful movie endings ever. This ending has something I like to call a callback. This is a term I totally made up, but what I mean by it is a resolution to a question presented earlier in the film. In this case, we find out that it was Coop sending binary (morse) encoded messages through space and time to his daughter Murph. This realization is the craziest, wildest, and a most incredible end to wrap up this film. I can't do justice to it, you'll just have to see for yourself what I mean by this mind-blowing moment.\n\nSo yeah. I could go on and on, but I just realized I wrote a 5 paragraph, 1000-word essay and said probably overused the word beautiful, so I'm going to stop now and let you all leave your thoughts in the comments down below.

Is Pietro from the multiverse, or did Wanda actually \u201crecast\u201d him, and he has no significance to a possible introduction to the multiverse? 2. Would Vision be able to survive once Wanda\u2019s bubble goes away? 3. What is going to happen to really everyone in Westview when the bubble goes away? Episode 6 sort of addressed the first two questions but didn\u2019t provide any solid answers. When Wanda and Pietro are talking about the past, sometimes they remember it differently, possibly suggesting the multiverse, but Pietro also remembers getting killed by Ultron, so it\u2019s really hard to tell. Also, this season\u2019s villain has yet to be revealed, and I think it\u2019s definitely possible that \u201cPietro\u201d is this season\u2019s villain. Then, we saw Vision trying to leave the bubble, and once he escapes the fence, he starts disintegrating, but Wanda expands the bubble to save him, which engulfs the entire S.W.O.R.D. Base as well. So it seems like Vision is unable to survive outside the bubble, but I guess we\u2019ll have to wait and see for sure.

You heard me right: The Silence of the Lambs was released on Valentine\u2019s Day, which is so funny to me. I'd like to start this off by saying I don't usually go for movies that have a rap for being scary. I can say without a doubt that this the best scary movie I've ever seen. It doesn't really fit into the stereotypical \"horror\" genre because the main story focuses on catching a serial killer/Dr. Lecter's escape. If I had to be even more specific I'd label this as a psychological thriller. I mean so much of the movie revolves around Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling's mind games. I won't go too much into a summary of the plot but basically, Clarice Starling is tasked with getting information from Lecter on how to capture a new serial killer, Buffalo Bill, which unintentionally allows Lecter to escape from captivity while he was being held in Tennessee. \n\nIt's really hard for me to quantify why I like this movie. As I mentioned before, I really don't watch many scary movies. If I had to identify one thing, it's the first watch factor. I'm not sure if this is a real thing, but some movies are incredible the first time you see them and proceed to lose value in the subsequent watches. Most of why this film is so acclaimed, I believe, is because of how shocking and scary all of the content is to viewers that have never seen the movie. As I said before, there are so many psychological elements at play in the movie, and this film did a great job at projecting some of that into the audience. So when you view the film for the first time, you're really roped into it, but in the second and third views, you know what's happening so that shock and fright start to diminish. On another note, after watching this film I finally understood that scene from The Office where Dwight cuts the face off the CPR training dummy.

This party remains faceless and communicates solely through text message, adding to the mystery of this antagonistic force.

I wanted to do a 45th-anniversary review of Taxi Driver, but I looked it up and realized I missed it on Feb. 8th. I know you're probably wondering why I scored this movie a little low considering how it's typically very acclaimed by most movie critics. And the main reason I rated this movie at 79% is due to one factor that comes with watching this movie post-2019: The Irishman. I actually saw the Irishman before watching Goodfellas, and I noticed a ton of similarities; I mean obviously both were crime films directed by Martin Scorsese and had Robert De Niro & Joe Pesci playing major roles in the film. They both use the exact same style of narration: the main character (Henry & Karen Hill for Goodfellas, Frank Sheeran for The Irishman) narrates the story from the future, meaning they tell the story how they see it looking back at it. I think Martin's Scorsese's ability to make a good crime film actually improved over time, as I like The Departed and The Irishman better than Goodfellas. The reason is that they contain much more action than Goodfellas does. I know many people won't agree with my opinion, but I like a movie with more action, and that's how I feel.\n\nWith that being said let's take a look at what Goodfellas did right. It did a fantastic job of projecting Henry & Karen's emotions on to the audience; it made us feel all of the complex dilemmas and emotions they were going through during the film. One of the major premises of the film is focusing on how a crime family works. We saw the incredible loyalty and devotion associated with it. Especially after Karen & Henry get married, and Karen is roped into the family. And I think that's important to note, that the crime family really was a family! Throughout the film, we see many gatherings and dinners among the members. Henry and Karen's kids even refer to the crime boss, Paulie, as Uncle Paulie. On the other side of the coin, we have the negative aspect of loyalty, which is mainly shown with the murder of Pesci's character, Tommy, who got killed because he killed another \"made\" member of the family. \n\nSo yeah, this film did a great job of showing the deep complexities associated with crime families; I was just bored at some points during the film. That's the reason why I take The Irishman or The Departed over Goodfellas. And I get that Goodfellas intentionally is not supposed to contain much action, so it's kind of hard to directly compare to The Departed, but I made the comparison given that they're all Scorsese crime films.",type:"movie",title:"Goodfellas",rating:79,timestamp:1613399004842,director:"Martin Scorsese",runtime:148,genre:"Crime",mpaa:"R",trailer:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ilzidi_J8Q",releaseYear:1990,admin:0,poster:"https://www.dhsspectrum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/good.web_.jpg",likes:[0],id:17},{content:"As a new fan to NASCAR and as a person interested in NASCAR's recent efforts to reinvent themselves and break out of its decline from the early 2000s, I had high hopes for The Crew.

But after watching the first episode, these hopes were dampened. The Crew is your typical sitcom type show with the annoying laugh tracks and thin plot line. In addition to the overall subpar nature of the show, there are glaring errors and inconsistencies in the first episode, such as showing a blimp shot of one track as exposition, and the set clearly being at a different track.

El Camino is a sequel to Breaking Bad that serves as an epilogue for the show, as it takes place just seconds after the end of Breaking Bad, along with a few flashbacks to earlier points on the timeline of the show. This film gave us the story of Jesse\u2019s ending, just as S5E16 gave us Walt\u2019s ending.\n\nThe plot line is very simple: Jesse needs to get money in order to pay the \u201cdisappearing guy\u201d so he can get to Alaska. He chooses Alaska because we see in a flashback that Mike would have chosen to go to Alaska if he could start over. Jesse steals the money from Todd\u2019s old apartment, along with a few complications. We also get a bunch of flashbacks to Jesse\u2019s time being imprisoned by Todd, and wow does Todd look 15 years older in El Camino than Breaking Bad, even though they were released just 6 years apart. My favorite part of the movie was the ending, where we got 2 cameos. One was a flashback with Walt, where he\u2019s asking Jesse what he wants to do with his life, and the other is a flashback with Jane, who I always appreciate flashing back to, where she\u2019s saying how it\u2019s better to follow your own path instead of letting the universe guide you. And with that, Jesse, of his own will, drives into the wintertime-Alaskan forest and disappears. \n\nGetting the closure for Jesse\u2019s character as well as the ending with the flashback to Jane made this a great movie that I really enjoyed watching.

I'm probably going to start to review his movies chronologically by release date with a few exceptions (I haven't seen Pulp Fiction because it hasn't been on Netflix yet). This review is going to serve also as an introduction to Tarantino as well as a review for Reservoir Dogs. Tarantino is notorious for his bloody, violent films. Every single one that I've seen so far has been at least somewhat violent (even Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood). He's even been quoted to say, \"Violence is one of the most fun things to watch.\" I would definitely say he does violence better than every other director ever. So that's a brief intro to Tarantino: violent stories, and Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nSo, now onto Reservoir Dogs. Currently, I can say with no hesitation that this is his worst movie in my opinion. As of writing this, I've seen Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill: Volume1&2, Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight, and Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood. And I'd have to guess that I'd like Pulp Fiction better than this. Let's start with what I liked about this movie: the way the story was told. The story was told in an en media res style, where we're thrown right into an action scene, to begin with, and then we go back in time to examine the events that led up to the car chase. The other thing that was impressive was how low of a budget this film was shot on. This is impressive due to the cost to make vs. the success of the film ratio. \n\nMy main issues with this film are the story. I think that it lacked the usual Tarantino substance. It's a simple story: A crew of anonymous bank robbers is infiltrated by an undercover cop, so the diamond heist goes wrong, leading to casualties of both cops and bank robbers. I summarized the essence of the story in a sentence. Obviously, it's much more nuanced than what I said, as we go back in time to see what led to the robbery, but I really thought the film was lacking and a little boring in places. When compared to something like The Hateful Eight, which also has similar elements where the viewer is trying to figure out which character actually caused something, Reservoir Dogs doesn't do all that good of a job in blowing our minds with how it's revealed that Mr. Orange was an undercover cop.\n\nSo yeah, those are my brief thoughts on Reservoir Dogs: important because it was Tarantino's big break, but my least favorite of his work.",type:"movie",title:"Reservoir Dogs",rating:77,timestamp:1613769728387,director:"Quentin Tarantino",runtime:100,genre:"Crime",mpaa:"R",trailer:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vayksn4Y93A",releaseYear:1992,admin:0,poster:"https://i.redd.it/7v0gfrpy8kqy.jpg",likes:[3,0,2],id:20},{content:"Ok so some big things happened in episode 7, so let's dive right in. I was speculating in my review for episode 6 that Pietro might be the bad guy of the show, and I was wrong about that, but not really. The biggest reveal we got in episode 7 was that Agnes is actually Agatha Harkness, who I'm not super familiar with because I haven't really read any of the comics. Anyways, the huge reveal of this episode was that it was actually Agatha, not Wanda, that's been in control of everything in the Hex, including Pietro. So we finally got the big question answered of who's behind all this, but it also poses yet another huge question: will Agatha be a friendly or not so friendly. I assumed after the episode that she would probably end up being the villain, but after a quick google search it turns out that she was a friend of Wanda's in the comics, so I guess we'll see which route Marvel chooses to go here. \n\nThe other big thing that took place in this episode was that Monica gained powers upon entering the Hex. This wasn't really a huge reveal or anything because it was largely speculated that she would end up with abilities at some point during the show. I'm not very familiar with Monica's character from the comics, so I don't really know too much about her abilities, but I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens. \n\nSo what does this all mean? If I had to make a guess I'd have to say that the introduction of Agatha Harkness will somehow lead to the upcoming Doctor Strange sequel and that Monica's powers will be on full display in Captain Marvel 2. Even though I didn't really know much about Agatha Harkness before watching this episode, I still really appreciated the big shocking reveal at the end of the episode. I also love a good twist in the ending.

This film follows Hollywood legend Humphrey Bogart playing a private investigator pulled into the twisted mess of three individuals all desperately chasing a fabled gem-encrusted Falcon. \n\nFrom the exposition of the film, with a murder only minutes in, the audience knows immediately that this story may not go how they expect. While the scale of the entire film is small, playing out entirely in a few select locations in San Francisco, the deep and complex plot is thoroughly developed by the stellar dialogue and pacing. All of the actors and actresses have incredible chemistry, and present flawlessly the interpersonal tension and atmosphere of each interaction. Each successive scene gives the viewer more insight into the frenzy to find the Falcon, and the steady addition of new characters throws consistent curveballs at the audience\u2019s prediction of what is really going on. Step by step, the introduction of acting legends Mary Astor as O'Shaughnessy, Peter Lorre as Mr. Cairo, and Sydney Greenstreet as \u2018The Fat Man\u2019 (important to note, an amazing performance for his first feature film role) adds character contrast and unpredictable behavior to each encounter. The viewer\u2019s expectations and guesses are constantly teased and played with, leaving the audience truly questioning until further information is revealed. The film advances in an interesting fashion, not developing characters always by actions that occur on screen, but by treading backwards and slowly revealing events that occurred leading up to the situations shown in the film. The end result is a dense, captivating film that packs sharp discourse and fantastic storytelling in barely over 100 minutes.\n\nIn summary, The Maltese Falcon is full of action, suspense, and dialogue which keeps you intrigued and constantly wondering what comes next. Incredibly well-written and beautifully shot, it is obvious why the film is critically acclaimed and regarded as a landmark Hollywood achievement, and one of the best films ever made. It is a workshop on mystery storytelling and how to keep an audience invested. For a film lover, this is simply a must-see due to its notoriety and legacy on the genre and film as a whole.

The sole reason I watched this show was that Victoria Pedretti is in it, and I absolutely love her. Not that I know what I'm talking about, but she is such a skilled actor, and has killed every role she's done so far (you can also see her in The Haunting of Hill House, and You S2). I should also note that it was extremely hard to rate this based on the actual show, and not give it a 90-something because Victoria was in it. But at least I can try, right?\n\nThe Haunting of Bly Manor is the second installment of The Haunting anthology series, with The Haunting of Hill House coming before it. To start off, this show (and its predecessor) just kind of bums me out; there are some really sad moments in the show. I really appreciated the cinematography for this show, the camera work basically facilitated every good jump scare in the show. I'm not a big fan of jump scares, but I could see how well-done they were. Another thing the show did great was introducing mysteries early in the show that was resolved nicely later. I can explain what I mean by this with an example: early in the show we see a ghost of a plague-doctor, and it's not until the last couple of episodes that we find out why it's there in the first place. As with The Haunting of Hill House, this show's biggest strength lies in its ending, specifically the satisfaction the viewer feels once they finally understand everything that happened. This show is super confusing, and you basically spend the entire show trying to figure out what's happening, only to have everything revealed in the season finale.\n\nWhen making this show, Flanagan chose to bring on a few of the cast members from The Haunting of Hill House. I think he chose the best of the bunch to return for the next installment in this anthology (I mean if he chose to bring Victoria Pedretti back then obviously he took the best), so it's no wonder the cast of characters was so great.\n\nSo yeah, to sum this show up, it had a great season finale, a great mechanism for revealing the entire ghost story, and obviously a great set of actors playing great roles. I can only rate a horror show so high; it's just not one of my favorite genres. Also, I think the show took a little while to get rolling, as the back-half of the show was much better than the front-half. @ me in the comments if you agreed or thought differently, or have any additional thoughts.

Your Name tells the story of a teenage boy and girl who miraculously switch bodies with each other during the day, living the other person\u2019s life a few times every week. Even if you\u2019ve never seen a single Shinkai film, after watching Your Name you\u2019ll understand why it is his masterpiece. And if you have seen other Shinkai before, well, you\u2019ll understand too.\n\nThe story of Your Name is not irregular compared to other films by Shinkai. He has numerous Romance and Fantasy animated films, all with their own unique component, such as Weathering With You\u2019s meteorological superpowers or The Garden of Words\u2019s distinct scenery. In Your Name, the component itself is not even unique: stories involving characters \u2018switching bodies\u2019 have been seen multiple times before in cinema. Yet, Shinkai is the first to perfect it. Immediately, Shinkai throws us into the body-switching antics of main characters Taki and Mitsuha with effectively no buildup. The two, a few days a week, switch bodies and live the life of the other for the day, until they go to sleep. Shinkai makes these situations simultaneously comedic and dramatic, as silly moments where the characters discover the \u2018parts\u2019 of their counterpart pivot to moments of suspense where one does not know what the other said or did while in their body. Taki and Mitsuha have never met in person, but they communicate to one another by leaving notes while in the others\u2019 body. While the viewer might expect that they simply fall in love and meet each other in person, living happily ever after, they\u2019d be quite mistaken. The body-switching is only a launch pad for so much more. But, for the sake of the beauty of this film, I won\u2019t reveal any additional information here. If you\u2019re reading this before watching, I highly recommend going into Your Name with limited information beforehand, so I won\u2019t reveal too much more in this review.\n\nThe reason that this storyline is so amazing is because of the emotions it evokes from the viewer. Numerous times, moments switch from being heartwarming to heart-wrenching, from breathtaking to devastating. There are sections of absolute satisfaction and joy, but also periods of incredible dissatisfaction, with something so in reach yet so far away. The first sizable chunk of the film deals solely with the characters living in each others\u2019 bodies, which Shinkai uses as a tool to make the viewer emotionally invested in Taki and Mitsuha. Awkward encounters, surprisingly fortunate events, and humorously wild antics relate the audience to the two teenagers, building the connection to the viewer so you feel as strongly as the characters do as events play out later in the film. \n\nRegardless of the story, the animation is, simply put, sensational. It might very well be the most beautiful animation I\u2019ve ever seen come out of Japan (the only contenders being other Shinkai films or some of the Ghibli catalog). The character design, the meticulously detailed scenery, the lighting, all contribute to a brilliant and beautiful visual experience for the entire length of the film. In addition, the score does a fantastic job enhancing the visuals and the dialogue to further emphasize the emotions Shinkai elicits from the viewer.  \n\nIn summary, Shinkai has made a visual and narrative masterpiece with Your Name. Regardless of if Romance, Fantasy, or Japanese animation are your cup of tea, this film is highly worth the watch. As I said earlier, the best way to approach Your Name is with little information prior. If you can get it on a big screen, you\u2019ll be able to appreciate all the small visual details added in. Shinkai made no compromises with this film, and that shows in its flawless visuals and ability to evoke raw emotion from its audience.

It's amazing to me how long the two of these movies are combined given the simple nature of the story: a story of revenge. Kill Bill is split into 10 chapters, with Volume 1 covering the first 5, and Volume 2 the second 5. I'll do more of an analysis on the whole story in my review of Volume 2, so let's start with the first 5 chapters.\n\nThe title of the film effectively lays out the entire backbone of the story: it's a revenge story, with the end goal of the protagonist (The Bride) being to kill Bill. I should mention that The Bride is one of my favorite main characters in any film I've seen; I've even spent a good hour or so trying to make a GTA Online avatar that looks like her. Throughout the 10 chapters, we tend to jump around in time a bunch, so I'll do my best to keep that straight for you all. The Bride used to be a member of The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, which was headed by Bill. I won't get into the details, but Bill brutally betrays The Bride, leaving her in a coma for years, and upon waking up, The Bride wants nothing but vengeance. Given that the combined runtime of these two films is over 4 hours, it's really important that the exposition of the story provides a powerful reason for why revenge is needed: something that will keep the viewer invested the whole time. I can wholeheartedly say that this film does a fantastic job of this. \n\nI usually don't like to go too much into the plot, in case some readers haven't seen the movie, but I will just give a quick outline of the plot of the first volume: The Bride wakes up from a coma, and then goes on a MISSION to kill every last member of The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. The majority of volume 1 focuses on The Bride's journey to kill O-Ren Ishii. What's really interesting is some different mediums of film used throughout volume 1. For example, chapter 3 tells the story of O-Ren Ishii as narrated by The Bride, and this chapter is all in an anime. I haven't ever really seen anime blended in with live-action before, so it was really cool to see. It made some of the violent scenes comical, as the blood would unrealistically spew like a fountain. \n\nThe highlight of both Kill Bill volumes, for me, comes in chapter 5, the end of volume 1. This is the epic showdown between The Bride (decked out in that awesome yellow jumpsuit from the movie poster), and O-Ren Ishii. The Bride uses her new Hanzo Steel sword to go ham on all of O-Ren Ishii's henchmen. This is one of the goriest scenes in any film, and it's really cool because some of the shots from the fight scene were in black and white to reduce the gore. Kill Bill: Volume 1 ends in the most epic way possible, with O-Ren getting \"a haircut.\"\n\nThe reason why I rated volume 1 higher than volume 2 was mainly because of this last fight scene - it was one of the best fight scenes in any movie. We'll pick up the rest of this story in the second review...",type:"movie",title:"Kill Bill: Volume 1",rating:91,timestamp:1614179793544,director:"Quentin Tarantino",runtime:112,genre:"Action",mpaa:"R",trailer:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kSuas6mRpk",releaseYear:2003,admin:0,poster:"https://cdn.europosters.eu/image/1300/posters/kill-bill-vol-1-i97652.jpg",likes:[0,5],id:25},{content:"Alright, so I'm gonna pick up from where we left off on the Kill Bill: Volume 1 review, so if you haven't seen that one, I'd suggest going to check it out before reading this one. So we left off with The Bride taking care of O-Ren Ishii, meaning only 2 members of The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad + Bill remain. So the majority of this volume focuses on The Bride's journey to Bill, along with finding Budd & Elle, but we also have an entire chapter devoted to showing how The Bride got trained in martial arts by Pai Mei. This chapter takes place in the past, so we also get to see a little bit of The Bride's relationship with Bill. So volume 2 follows this arc: flashback to the event where Bill and the squad betrayed The Bride, finding Bill's brother Budd (who was a member of the squad), finding Elle (another member of the squad), and getting face to face with Bill. I'm not going to dive into the plot too much, but instead, I'll talk about the scenes that I thought were really cool.\n\nFirst, the scene when The Bride gets buried alive and escapes by punching the coffin repeatedly until it breaks. The reason why this scene is so cool is mainly that it's right after the chapter where we flashback to The Bride's training with Pai Mei. One of the things we see The Bride working hard to master is a 3-inch punch. After we see The Bride struggle with breaking a piece of wood and finally master it, we cut back to the future (haha movie reference within a movie review) where The Bride uses the 3-inch punch to break the wood and climb out of the grave. \n\nSecond, and this is my favorite scene in volume 2, The Bride uses the five-point-palm-exploding-heart-technique. This had been foreshadowed heavily throughout volume 2, which was why it made for a satisfying ending. We heard about this technique from Bill, who said only Pai Mei knew it. It's almost like the symbolic knife in some films, where if we see it we know it has to be used at some point; this is exactly what happened here.\n\nA bonus little nugget is that that one meme song appears a lot in this movie (just google Kill Bill Ironside or Quincy Jones Ironside to see which one I'm talking about). This sound effect almost makes some of the scenes a little cheesy but in a good funny sort of way.\n\nSo this is going to be a wrap-up for both volumes 1 and 2 since they're the same story. As I mentioned at the beginning of my review for volume 1, this is the best revenge tale in cinema in my opinion. It's such a simple motivation for the main character, but Tarantino did an awesome job of creating a detailed plot that maintained the viewer's focus throughout the combined 4-hour runtime. Tarantino always nails the art of story-telling, and this is no exception. The actors all played their characters fantastic, and the way the story was organized into 10 chapters kept the flow nice and neat, especially when there were jumps in time. In addition, the switching between anime, black and white, and the color was really unique and awesome to see. And then there's what this movie is perhaps most famous for its brutal violence, which is what Tarantino is known best for. In this story, it fits with The Bride's motive of ruthless revenge and vengeance, and although it was exaggerated a lot in the film, it made for some very interesting and satisfying scenes. \n\nSo where does Kill Bill stack up with other Tarantino films? I can't give a great answer for this primarily because I haven't seen Pulp Fiction, which is widely considered to be Tarantino's best work, but I can still try. Of the ones I have seen (Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill, Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight, and Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood) I'd have to say it's my favorite, right in front of Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood and Inglorious Basterds, but this could also change once I review the rest of Tarantino. I'm going to try and get to the rest of Tarantino soon, so stay tuned.\n\nSo yeah, this one was definitely a long one, so if you read my terrible writing to the end, @ me in the comments so I can reply!

I'm not going to waste any time introducing Nolan or anything like that, since I've already reviewed a handful of his other films. If any of you haven't read any of my other Nolan reviews, just know that I'm a little biased because he is my favorite director by far.\n\nLet's dive right in. Two words I would use to sum this movie up are obsession and devotion. You'll have to watch this movie to know what I mean. This film tells the tale of 2 rival magicians who compete for attention and each other's secrets for how they perform tricks. It's set in Victorian London, but if I had to date it, I'd put it around the turn of the century (the 1890s). The reason for this is because of Nikola Tesla appearing as a character in the film (portrayed by Starman himself David Bowie!), although of course, this is fiction, so there's really no way of telling exactly. Even before I saw this movie for the first time, I knew I was in for a treat, I mean Nolan + magicians? That's a combo that could easily include some of the best twists and tricks for a film. And boy was I right, my very favorite part of this movie was this major twist at the very end of the film; the writing for the scene was so perfect.\n\nAs far as characters go, we have some really good ones. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman portray the dueling magicians, alongside Michael Caine as the mentor figure (like he always is in any Nolan film). I really enjoy the way the story was told. The whole story is narrated by Michael Caine's character, Cutter, and the film opens chronologically towards the end, but then we make a jump back to the beginning of the story and proceed mostly chronologically from there. In addition, Nolan used a second storytelling device that I thought was really creative and brought 2 other (somewhat unreliable) narrative perspectives into view. What I mean by this was we also have part of the story told from the journals of Borden and Angier. What gets even more confusing is the two diaries were written very cryptically, as Border purposely tries to trick Angier at one point by letting him read his diary. I know it's confusing, and I didn't do a great job of explaining, but the main takeaway is the story is told in a purposely confusing manner, but it makes for an incredible viewing experience.\n\nAnd of course, as with all Nolan films, you can expect a fantastic ending, with a huge twist. It's so beautiful because the film is structured into 3 stages exactly like a magic trick: the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. So the ending of the film is like the reveal of the magic trick when you're in disbelief of what just happened, and it feels so awesome.\n\nSo yeah, I highly recommend giving this one a watch, as I do with all Nolan films. @ me in the comments with anything I missed, or with any additional thoughts you have!",type:"movie",title:"The Prestige",rating:92,timestamp:1614396509800,director:"Christopher Nolan",runtime:130,genre:"Mystery/Drama",mpaa:"PG-13",trailer:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLtaA9fFNXU",releaseYear:2006,admin:0,poster:"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/35/66/3b/35663bd80d174c1f251d9d1d3f793b9c.jpg",likes:[0],id:27},{content:"Ok, so we learned a ton of new info about Wanda and Agatha in this episode.

In the memory with Wanda\u2019s parents, we see that they all loved watching old sitcoms, especially Wanda, so we now know where Wanda\u2019s own sitcom drew inspiration from.\n3. Wanda didn\u2019t actually steal Vision\u2019s body as Hayward said, the Vision we see in the hex is purely created by Wanda\u2019s magic. \n4. In the post-credits scene, we learn that Hayward and S.W.O.R.D. Rebuilt Vision\u2019s body, and power hi, up with some of Wanda\u2019s chaos magic! We\u2019ll have to stay tuned to see if it\u2019ll actually be Vision or not.\n\nSo yeah, this was a really great episode since we learn a lot about Wanda\u2019s past that we previously on,y knew about from the brief stories she told from it. Also, another question I have is still regarding the appearance of Pietro from X-men. We know that it was Agatha\u2019s doing, but what is the significance of it being the Pietro from X-men? Agatha even tells Wanda that she wanted to get the real Pietro, but obviously, she couldn\u2019t since he\u2019s dead. So I\u2019m a little confused still on why we had the cameo from Quicksilver from X-men. Anyways, @ me in the comments with anything I missed or any thoughts you had on episode 8!",type:"show",title:"WandaVision",season:1,episode:8,rating:90,timestamp:1614430967168,director:"Matt Shakman",genre:"Action/Sci-fi",mpaa:"TV-PG",trailer:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj9J2ecsSpo",releaseYear:2021,admin:0,poster:"https://pm1.narvii.com/7689/fb2e709e62d985ae075d9f97d30c11f2a5cc88ber1-369-534v2_uhq.jpg",likes:[0],id:28},{content:"Simply put, Junichi Sato\u2019s A Whisker Away does a lot of things right. It has interesting characters and an exciting plot, in addition to visuals, score, and voice acting to make it a great viewing experience. But, there are things A Whisker Away does that stop it from being great.\n\nThe primary draw of the film is, well, cats. The main character, Miyo, has obtained a method to turn herself into a house cat. Once in her feline form, she uses it to get closer to her schoolboy crush, Taro, who doesn\u2019t realize this friendly cat is one of his classmates. Later on, we learn her ability comes from a cat-shaped masquerade mask she obtained from the magical Mask Seller. He acts as a liaison between cats and humans, allowing either species to transform into the other with these masks. The central conflict comes when the Mask Seller wants to take away Miyo\u2019s humanity to sell it, and she would be forced to stay a cat forever, never to return to her human form. But, within all this plot, there are writing and concept choices that I find questionable. \n\nThe first noticeable thing when watching this film is the inspiration drawn from Spirited Away by Studio Ghibli. Not that this is a bad thing, because their filmography is renowned, but the choices on what to draw from feel odd. For one, the idea of the Mask Seller felt very similar to Yubaba in Spirited Away. The Mask Seller as an antagonist wants to keep Miyo as a cat forever, just as Yubaba wants to keep Chihiro in the spirit world. But, the Mask Seller effectively is just a worse, underwhelming, and one-dimensional version of Yubaba. The Mask Seller himself actually has almost no power; he is easily held down by a handful of cats. Throughout the movie he has no character development whatsoever, and has no intrigue as a villain. He\u2019s simply an annoyance, and adds almost nothing to the story as an entity. As well, the giant, floating, invisible tree that serves as the \u2018Island of Cats\u2019 resembles a mashup of Spirited Away\u2019s spirit world and James Cameron\u2019s Na\u2019Vi-dwelling Hometree in Avatar. Because they spend such little time there, it feels like an afterthought. I believe there was ample untapped potential to use the island as a much bigger plot device and setting, given how detailed and fantastical it briefly was. \n\nAnother large facet of the film that seems odd is the decisions characters make, most specifically the main character Miyo. First and foremost, I\u2019m not sure which writer wrote Miyo jumping off the roof of a two story building to stop some schoolboys slandering her crush. Why was that necessary or logical? On top of that, who wrote the constant harassment she gives Taro, not to mention the constant embarrassment she puts him under. Obviously the writers want to show that Miyo is young, ignorant, but has a passion for Taro. But her behavior feels forced and strange. The writers tried so hard to show she has a crush on him that it just comes across as odd and unrealistic. Other than matters involving Taro, her decision making throughout the entire film is questionable. There are numerous times that the central conflict could be solved instantly. Typically, this is not always a bad thing, but in the film it is so forced the idea that Miyo just doesn\u2019t quite understand the Mask Seller\u2019s intentions that it\u2019s almost painful to sit through. As a whole, Miyo is just plain stupid, irrational, and uncomfortable, thus the audience barely relates to her character or forms empathy for her struggle. \n\nAlthough my review is rather critical, the viewing experience is still positive. It has impressive visuals, a story that, at the minimum, keeps you somewhat invested, and wraps up nicely at its conclusion. There are just a few items that I question the decision to include in the film, and some adjustments that could be made to improve it as a whole. The best way to enter the film is not hoping to explore it too deeply, and just to enjoy it for what it is: a simple, fun-to-watch story of two kids, with a little bit of magic here and there. If you\u2019re already a fan of Japanese animation, then A Whisker Away is definitely worth the watch, but otherwise, take it for what it is.\n",type:"movie",director:"Junichi Sato",rating:73,title:"A Whisker Away",timestamp:1614462191721,runtime:104,genre:"Romance/Fantasy",mpaa:"NR",trailer:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXc9DVfLTGo",releaseYear:2020,admin:5,poster:"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDI5ODBhYzMtNDc4Yi00NjEwLWJiZWUtMGE2Mzc4MGVjN2E0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_.jpg",likes:[0,5],id:29},{content:"Today we're going to be taking a look at James Cameron's sci-fi masterpiece, Avatar (yes, the one with the blue people). As you probably could have guessed by now, sci-fi is by far my favorite genre to watch, which is why I was super excited to get to review Avatar. There's really no other word I can use to describe this film other than monumental. In the future, I'm probably going to be diving into other older revolutionary sci-fi films, but for now, I'll get into why I think Avatar is one of the latest in the line of groundbreaking sci-fi films. The reason why is so simple: absolutely incredible CGI. I mean that's probably the biggest reason why this movie set so many box office records back in the day (well, this and the fact that it stayed in theaters for over half a year).\n\nI should mention that CGI is definitely a double-edged sword: if you do it wrong, people will tend to complain about it, but if you do it right, it makes for an incredibly immersive film that has the power to transport you into environments that aren't creatable just by shooting on earth. And this is really what I believe Avatar does better than almost any other CGI of its time, it was able to create a planet so unique and different from the earth that it had that incredible out-of-this-world immersive feel that captured audiences for the entire 2h42m runtime. Now not only is the entire environment CGI, but the Na'vi and the wild creatures are also all completely CGI. In my opinion, the best CGI is the kind where you can't tell it's CGI, and this is exactly what Cameron and his team nailed in this film.\n\nOk, so what else did this movie do right other than CGI? I'd have to say the score and the characters. To quickly mention the score, it was beautiful all the way through (google Avatar main theme to see what I mean). Zoe Saldana and Sam Worthington star alongside sci-fi legend Sigourney Weaver (Alien review coming soon, probably from legendary critic TrevorC), and all three of them absolutely nail the roles. \n\nGetting into the plot a little bit, the entire film is set on the planet Pandora, which is inhabited by the native Na'vi (the blue people). A big conglomerate from earth called the RDA set up mining operations on Pandora to mine an extremely rare and priceless called unobtainium (wow, nice name!). Of course, their mining operation is absolutely destroying the wildlife, sparking conflicts with the local Na'vi. The scientists working for RDA are trying their absolute hardest to resolve this conflict peacefully by transplanting their consciousness into Na'vi avatar bodies, but things get out of control when RDA's military wants to burn down the local wildlife, so obviously the scientists team with the Na'vi to stop them. The one negative thing I have to say about the plot was that it was very predictable. \n\nSo yeah, to sum this one up, it was an epic sci-fi adventure fueled by what I think is the best CGI to date (even after 12 years).

Due to the nature of the pandemic, it has been hard to watch new release films either due to not seeing marketing or not wanting to head to the theater. The Trial of the Chicago 7 eluded my sights until I happened upon it on Netflix. Doing more research, I was intrigued to see it had received numerous nominations, including best picture, director, screenplay, on top of multiple awards for specific cast members. Thus, I knew I had to give it a chance. The film tells the story of the Chicago 7, a cohort of anti-Vietnam War protestors charged with conspiracy and crossing state lines with the intention of inciting riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\nThe first thing to note about this film is the casting: it\u2019s flawless. Each individual actor and actress perfectly embodies the role of their character, in physical appearance, behavior, and delivery. There is nothing I would change about the portrayal of the seven defendants, especially standout performances by Eddie Redmayne and Sacha Baron Cohen. Even beyond them, Frank Langella\u2019s performance as the commanding and prejudiced Judge Julius Hoffman grabs the audience in every scene he takes part in. And let\u2019s not forget Joseph Gordon-Levitt, whose polished performance as attorney Richard Schultz effortlessly makes the character\u2019s story dynamic and intriguing for the entire duration of the film. And finally, we must applaud Mark Rylance for his role as defense attorney William Kuntzler, perfectly playing a man fighting against a system that won\u2019t let him win. I can easily regard this film as one of the most well cast I\u2019ve ever viewed. Regardless of the story, I could thoroughly enjoy watching this movie just to see all the actors and actresses shine in their roles. \n\nIn regards to the plot, it is very well constructed. It is an interpolation of scenes in the courthouse, flashbacks in time, sections of Sacha Baron Cohen doing standup with jokes relevant to the current plot point, and back at the house in between trial days. Despite the vast amount of changes in environment, it never feels jarring or haphazard. Rather, having these constant switch-ups gave depth and detail to a story that seemingly would have less, given it\u2019s entirely about a single trial that has occurred because of a brief string of events. It\u2019s written to keep the audience engaged as we learn more about what led up to the trial, and does a spectacular job at it. \n\nAs someone who knew nothing about this trial beforehand (even being a Chicago native myself), I was intrigued to see how it would play out, and went to research more on it after viewing the film. Because it caused me to do that, the goal of this style of historical drama was successful, thus I would highly recommend it to anyone reading this. At the bare minimum, I give my recommendation so you can see why it is nominated for so many things, because it definitely deserves it.\n",type:"movie",director:"Aaron Sorkin",rating:84,title:"The Trial of the Chicago 7",timestamp:1614540917387,runtime:130,genre:"Drama/Historical",mpaa:"R",trailer:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVb6EdKDBfU",releaseYear:2020,admin:5,poster:"https://i.redd.it/0q3ux2jmi0n51.jpg",likes:[0,5],id:31},{content:"Simply put, The Dark Knight is the greatest comic book movie ever made. It is difficult to attribute this to anything other than Heath Ledger's maniacal and Oscar-winning turn as the Joker. While he wasn't the first and won't be the last to take up the mantle of Batman's nemesis, Ledger will almost certainly go down in history as the definitive portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime. Knowing what he endured for the roll and that he never got the recognition he deserved after his untimely death makes watching the movie even more of an emotional experience. \n\nWhile he rightfully garners most of the praise, Ledger is by no mean the only actor to put on a masterclass in this movie. Christian Bale is a delightful Bruce Wayne / Batman, and his chemistry with Michael Caine as Alfred is as strong as ever. Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent is strong, and I particularly love the dry wit of Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox. I could go on, but seemingly every character in this movie is compelling and portrayed extremely well. I love all the different interactions they are allowed to have, and the hospital conversation between the Joker and newly minted Two-Face remains one of the most haunting dialogue scenes I've watched. Speaking of haunting scenes, I have to mention the movie's take on the Prisoner's Dilemma with the two ferries. In a movie as batshit crazy (pun intended) as this one, that moment of hope in humanity was truly inspiring.\n\nI have nothing but good things to say about this movie. It resides in the very upper echelon of Nolan films, a prestigious distinction. Hans Zimmer provides an incredible score, and every actor puts on a performance for the ages. I've watched this movie a dozen times, and I imagine I'll watch it at least a dozen more.

I\u2019ll be the first to admit I love his works, he\u2019s my favorite director ever. But how can an archaic thriller like Blackmail, the first ever British film with sound, stand up to the likes of Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, or any other number of Hitchcock\u2019s numerous thriller masterpieces? To combat this, we have to put it in context, both in terms of the era it was released in, and the point it is at in Hitchcock\u2019s career. The distinction I make with Blackmail is that it is a stepping stone; without it, those renowned, household-name films may never have come to full fruition. Thus, when analyzing Blackmail, we must take it for what it is: an early glimpse at a genius and pioneering filmmaker beginning to hone his craft.\n\nBlackmail tells the story of a woman, Alice, who kills a man who attempts to rape her. The woman\u2019s boyfriend Frank, a police detective, is put onto the murder case. Another man named Tracy, knowing information about the case, plans to blackmail them. As far as surface-level plot goes, that\u2019s pretty much it, except for some later developments I won\u2019t spoil here. It isn\u2019t until the movie ends and the viewer ponders for a bit that one can see the multiple levels Hitchcock was working on; blackmail is present far more than just on the facade. All of the characters are guilty in some way, and one could argue Alice, the person who actually committed the murder, is the least guilty of them all. Everyone except her is soaked with malicious intent. Will Frank counter-blackmail Tracy? Will Tracy blackmail more than just Alice and Frank? Will Frank blackmail Alice, considering their struggling relationship? The concept of guilt has no tangibility, it\u2019s one person\u2019s word against the other, and who\u2019s to say what is the truth? The scale of what plays out on screen is small, but part of the magic is how it leaves the viewer when it ends, pondering these questions of intent and guilt. \n\nIn addition to the intriguing story, Blackmail is overflowing with signs of Hitchcock. His positioning of the camera, both glaring and subtle symbolism, his portrayal of women, the concept of the spectator, distinct usage of light and shadow, and many more trademark ideas are present. The common \u2018seeing something you weren\u2019t supposed to\u2019 that is present in almost every Hitchcock thriller is front and center. Someone who has seen Hitchcock before could swiftly recognize Blackmail as his work. That is what makes it so great, viewing it over 90 years after its creation. It is young, 30-year-old Hitchcock stretching his wings, utilizing sound for the first time, piloting new techniques and building up his staples. It is an early signal pointing to him eventually becoming known as the \u2018Master of Suspense\u2019. Fans of the genre or of the master himself will enjoy Blackmail, at the very least as a time capsule of a director taking off into subsequent decades of masterpieces.\n",type:"movie",director:"Alfred Hitchcock",rating:83,title:"Blackmail",timestamp:1614734518213,runtime:85,genre:"Thriller",mpaa:"NR",trailer:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsVCz8ezhtg",releaseYear:1929,admin:5,poster:"https://www.brentonfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/blackmail-1929-dir-alfred-hitchcock-uk-kine-weekly-trade-magazine-ad-green.jpg",likes:[4,0,5],id:33},{content:"Alright so I know I said I'd be going in order on Tarantino, but Trevor is going to review Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained, so The Hateful Eight is the next on the list of what I've seen so far. Anyways, let's dive right into this one. The story behind this one is surprisingly simple given its 3h7m runtime. If I had to summarize it in a sentence, a few groups of travelers get stranded at a small haberdashery in the middle of remote Wyoming during a massive blizzard. With that being said, there are a lot of moving parts, which is why this movie is so long. In classic Tarantino fashion, this movie is partitioned into 6 chapters. The main idea of the story involves a bounty hunter transporting a prisoner to Red Rock, where she will be hung for her crimes, but things aren't that simple, as a band of outlaws are trying to free her. I'm not going to go too much further into the plot, but instead talk about what I liked and didn't like.\n\nAs always, Tarantino does a great job with the manner of storytelling and using a non-linear timeline to do so. Personally, I love when a movie will jump around in time to reveal things we didn't previously know or to explain the lead-up to an event that just happened in the present. The reason why I think this is so effective is that it allows the storyteller (in this case Tarantino) to shock us with some revelation, and then go back in time to explain it. If it were reversed, we'd know what was coming, which would kill the suspense or anticipation leading up. This was definitely what I enjoyed most about this movie. In addition, there's a big mystery element at play where we don't know who sides with who, and Tarantino does a great job of making the film unpredictable. There's nothing I hate more than when I can guess immediately who's going to be the true bad guy. \n\nIf there's one negative I could say about this movie, it would be the runtime. At 3h7m, this movie is just too long. And by too long, I mean there could have been a lot of dry portions cut out, and then we'd be looking at a 2h30m movie versus 3 hours. It just felt a little dragged out, and the lack of change in scenery really exacerbated this issue.\n\nSo yeah, in terms of other Tarantino films, I'd say this was probably my second least favorite, topping only Reservoir Dogs. It's still a good film but just doesn't stack up to the likes of Kill Bill and Inglorious Basterds in my opinion.

This season really did a great job setting a premise for the rest of the show, and had a great storyline of its own. The main character of the show is Richard Hendricks, who begins the show working at Hooli, a giant tech company modeled after the likes of Amazon, Google, and Apple. While there, his side project, Pied Piper, is seen by Hooli\u2019s CEO, Gavin Belson, the primary antagonist of the first season. The software is discovered to have an incredibly efficient means of compressing data, which makes the software highly valued by Belson. He wants to buy it from Hendricks, however, Hendricks had shared it with a venture capitalist, Peter Gregory, and Belson and Gregory to wage a bidding war which concludes with Hendricks taking $200,000 from Gregory for 5% of the company. The rest of the season follows Hendricks and his friends, mainly two coders Dinesh and Gilfoyle and Richard\u2019s assistant Jared aka OJ aka Donald, as they cope with the problems of building a viable product, culminating in a startup competition where Hendricks has a breakthrough and writes new code which shatters the theoretical limit of compression, winning them the competition.\n\nThis season is one of the best of the entire show, and is also the only season to feature one of my favorite characters, Peter Gregory, whose actor passed away between seasons 1 and 2. One of my favorite things about this show is that it is relatively accurate to what it would actually be like to begin a startup in the Valley. The characters are all unique enough that the dynamics between them are fun to watch but also every character makes sense in their role. This show also does a great job of satirizing big tech throughout.

This review is probably going to sound kind of similar to the one I did for Avatar, but it's because I think they share a lot of the same strengths. I'm definitely not going very far into the plot here, because I think most people know at least a little bit of what happens in this film. Anyways, a quick summary of this one is billionaire John Hammond builds a theme-park on an island name Isla Nublar, which is about 120 miles west of Costa Rica. He recruits two paleontologists to come to review his work, which was the resurrection of dinosaurs through DNA strands that were preserved for millennia inside of amber. And as you might have guessed, everything goes wrong when a massive storm hits the island, and dinosaurs are on the loose. As wonderfully stated by Ian Malcolm, \"Life finds a way.\"\n\nThe reason why this movie is one of my favorites is primarily for 2 reasons: the concept, and the score. The concept of resurrecting dinosaurs is not only fascinating, but it seems almost believable, especially with how far biological engineering has come in the past 28 years since this film was released. Spielberg does a tremendous job of capturing the audience and bringing them into this frightening world where dinos roam free alongside humans. I love how deep that concept is, that two species separated by millions of years walk on earth simultaneously. Not only did Spielberg nail this profound concept, but his execution of roping the audience into the fear of coming face to face with dinos is brilliant. One very famous example of this from this film is having water ripple whenever a T-Rex is nearby due to the shockwaves produced by the massive footsteps. It's these little things that pull you in and capture your attention for the entirety of the film.\n\nThen, I'm sure you all saw this coming, but I have to mention the score. As I mentioned in my review of Batman Begins, the Spielberg and Williams duo is my second favorite director-composer combo in history. Williams' work on Jurassic Park is some of his best in my opinion. If I had to rank it against his other notable scores, I would say it's 3rd, only trailing Star Wars and Indiana Jones. The Jurassic Park main theme is one of the most memorable and beautiful tracks from any movie and is one of my favorites.\n\nSo yeah, there are my quick thoughts on a classic.

However, the FBI believed that Jewell fit the profile of a hero bomber, and that he planted the bomb himself, only to gain fame for discovering it again. This was leaked to the press, and the media, eager for a story, pushed the narrative despite no conclusive evidence, disrupting Jewell's life in ways he did not deserve.

One of the defining characteristics in the book is a myriad of 80\u2019s references and callbacks that pull the whole thing together. They modified, or in many cases completely changed, so much of the book that it is barely recognizable. This leads to an extremely rushed and weak plot written with seemingly minimal effort . Add subpar acting and unconvincing dialogue and you end up with this movie. It is very hard to believe that this movie was directed by Spielberg.\n\n\tDespite my many criticisms, the movie was not entirely bad, which is why my score is still above 50. The visual scenes are incredible, with several impressive character avatars and multiple exciting action scenes. The overall concept of the film, which comes from the book, is still great. It takes place in the not-too-distant future, with the real world completely devastated by unspecified events. To escape this dismal reality, everyone spends the majority of their time in the OASIS, the first virtual simulation capable of accommodating anyone and everyone who wants to join it.

I really enjoyed doing week-by-week reviews for the past month, so I'll definitely do it again for The Falcon and The Winter Soldier in 2 weeks. Anyways, let's dive into the season finale. First off, the reason why I'm scoring this a little lower than some of the episodes is that I think my expectations were way too high. For one thing, I was a little bit let down by the final fight between Agatha and Wanda. It didn't really last all that long, and Wanda won so easily it wasn't even fair. Maybe this is because The Scarlet Witch is more powerful, but it was a little bit lacking. In addition, I was really hoping for some sort of awesome cameo from someone like Dr. Strange. Given that we really went into the magical realm in the last few episodes, and also that Agatha name-dropped the Sorcerer Supreme, I really thought we might get a quick cameo from Dr. Strange, so I was a little disappointed when we didn't.\n\nBut besides that, I thought this episode did a decent job of closing up the season. I don't have too many lingering questions, so I'm pretty content with how it ended. I guess the one question I have is what happened to white Vision, and what's going to happen with Monica Rambeau given what we saw in that post-credits scene with the Skrull. I'm guessing this was supposed to set up Captain Marvel 2, but I guess we'll see what happens. I really hope we get to see more of Agatha Harkness, Jimmy Woo, and Darcy Lewis in other MCU shows or movies; I really liked all of their characters throughout the show.\n\nSo yeah, this show was pretty good. It was definitely one of the more unique shows I've seen, with the whole TV show within a TV show going on. If you finished WandaVision, let me know your thoughts by @ing me in the comments.

This is going to be a very short wrap-up since I did reviews for every individual episode of the season, so if you're curious about more specific details, definitely go check out my episode-by-episode reviews! For me, this show really serves as a benchmark for the future of Marvel shows. This is the first one that was designed specifically for Disney Plus, and I think it was a really good start. A good analogy is that WandaVision is Marvel's version of The Mandalorian (only I like The Mandalorian a good deal better than WandaVision in my opinion). The MCU had been super movie focus, so this show was really a transition into the TV show scene. I think they made the transition pretty well, migrating many beloved characters such as Wanda Maximoff, Vision, Darcy Lewis, and Agent Woo over to this new sphere. I think this really was a unique concept, and it was super meta having a TV show within a TV show. With that being said, I think the show got off to a slow start. We didn't see any action happen until the very end of episode 3! Looking back at the show as a whole, the story looks super stretched out. What I mean by that is I really think they could have easily told that story with enough detail in 6-7 episodes versus the 9 that they chose to go with.\n\nHowever, once the show got rolling, it definitely got better. Not only that, but we were introduced to a few new notable additions to the MCU with grown-up Monica Rambeau and Agatha Harkness. I really hope we get to see more of Agatha in the future because I thought her character arc was very short-lived in this show. As for Monica, we know we're going to see more of her in Captain Marvel 2, so that's good news. The show leaves the future of both Wanda and Vision a mystery, so we'll have to see what happens with them in the future. As of the time I'm writing this, there is no confirmation of a WandaVision season 2, so I guess we'll have to wait and see how their character arcs are finished.\n\nNow that we have The Falcon and The Winter Soldier coming out in a couple of weeks, we kind of know what to expect now thanks to WandaVision setting a benchmark for future MCU shows. Obviously, WandaVision's concept was super unique, and I'd expect The Falcon and The Winter Soldier to be much more combat-based (which I'm really looking forward to), but at least we can expect to see many familiar faces from the existing MCU, and also some new ones.\n\nSo yeah, I really enjoyed going episode-by-episode, and I plan to do it again in 2 weeks with The Falcon and The Winter Soldier.

I had just watched the first Wonder Woman (which is a great movie) less than two weeks prior to refresh my memory, and now Christmas Day had arrived and the world premiere for WW84 was upon us. I had watched Pixar\u2019s Soul earlier that morning, which was fantastic, and had high hopes that Christmas would go 2-for-2 on great premieres. So to say Wonder Woman 1984 was disappointing is not exactly an understatement, but more not precisely what I\u2019m trying to say. It wasn\u2019t just disappointing, it was plain awful. \n\nEverything compelling about the first movie was sadly absent from the second. Rather than a powerful and driven female protagonist, we got a whining Gal Gadot that couldn\u2019t move past her previous film\u2019s trauma, and a Kristen Wiig side character that was simultaneously conniving, attempting to be quirky, and just plain stupid. Rather than a nefarious and omnipotent God of War antagonist like the original, we got the goofy and erratic businessman Maxwell Lord who grants wishes like a genie in a bottle. While the premise of a wish-fulfilling megalomaniac had neat moments, it created a story where Wonder Woman couldn\u2019t actually fight the main villain. He\u2019s not a combatant, he\u2019s just a normal guy, thus their final confrontation was simply boring. Instead, we were stuck watching Diana get beat up by Kristen Wiig, including watching a Cats-musical-inspired animal/human combo version of Wiig fight Diana in likely the worst lighting and choreography for a final fight scene I\u2019ve ever witnessed. Other than these few scenes, the movie has a surprising lack of action sequences, especially compared to the first Wonder Woman. This means most of the story is character interaction, but unfortunately, the writing of all the characters is confusing and strange, with the dialogue feeling unnatural and the interactions feeling forced. No amount of great acting by some the cast could make up for the abhorrent script. This is further compounded by the fact the movie is over two and a half hours long, stretching out bad scenes and dialogue much longer than they need to be.\n\nWithin WW84 itself, there are numerous more issues in story writing, the first of which being Chris Pine literally possessing an innocent man\u2019s body. Diana wishes him back to life, yet he has to inhabit the human body of another man, whose family and friends seemingly forget he exists. Diana sees no problem with basically eliminating an innocent man from existence for her dead boyfriend. And speaking of Chris Pine, somehow the knowledge he gave Diana about how planes fly was enough for her to learn how to fly herself. And no, I don\u2019t mean in a plane or with a wingsuit. Wonder Woman literally flies, sometimes with her arms out like wings on a plane, and other times in a Superman-esque pose. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it\u2019s Diana having her own version of flight school while the world goes to shit back on the ground. This flying section was entirely meaningless and a waste of time, and simultaneously messes up the DC film universe canon. She never utilizes this useful skill in any other DCEU film. Maybe DC will find a way to retcon this later, but for now we're left confused why they even gave her this ability. \n\nSpeaking of canon, as an entry in DC\u2019s extended universe of films, WW84 managed to introduce plot holes to the entire universe. First off, was it not an entire point made in Justice League that after Chris Pine died, she stayed to herself and didn\u2019t reveal herself to the world, hiding in secret amongst the world of man? Yet, in the first few minutes of WW1984, we see her fighting petty thieves in a crowded mall, swinging around like a dollar-store Spider-Man in full view of hundreds of civilians. The film implies that she has done this multiple other times too. Additionally, in the other DC films we get the impression that Diana had not seen Chris Pine since he died, but clearly that is untrue given she saw him fairly recently in 1984, when she briefly brought him back to life. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I grew up watching and reading much more DC shows/comics than Marvel, but I think DC should take some tips from Marvel and have better continuity between films in their own universe. The DCEU has so much potential, but they\u2019ve continued to find ways to screw it up. \n\nOverall, WW84 had potential. Just a few actions could drastically solve many of its issues: reduce the runtime to about two hours or less, change most of the dialogue, rewrite some larger plot points, and then you\u2019ve got a movie at least half as good as the first Wonder Woman. Patty Jenkins proved she could direct a great action movie with WW84\u2019s predecessor. But, as it stands, if Maxwell Lord offered me a wish, I\u2019d ask to have back the two and a half hours of Christmas Day I spent watching this mess.\n",type:"movie",director:"Patty Jenkins",rating:46,title:"Wonder Woman 1984",timestamp:1615480886783,runtime:151,genre:"Fantasy/Adventure",mpaa:"PG-13",trailer:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW2E2Fnh52w",releaseYear:2020,admin:5,poster:"https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5fd7c978f7e620bfe7854dba/960x0.jpg?fit=scale",likes:[5,9,0],id:41},{content:"In a shocking turn of events that nobody saw coming, the first Harrison Ford film I'm reviewing is not Star Wars! Today, we're going to be looking at The Fugitive. This one should end up being a relatively short review, as I really don't have too much to say about it. To give a super quick plot summary without spoiling too much, basically, it's a classic tale of a man being falsely accused of murder, and uncovering the truth and evidence to prove his innocence. So this movie wasn't doing anything revolutionary with the story, but the execution of this well-worn tale was pretty excellent in my opinion. With the Feds constantly on Richard Kimble's tale, there's always the risk of being captured around every corner, which provides for that exciting thrill that I look for in any good action-thriller. I really do think it was important to nail the execution of a story of this type since it's done a lot in movies. If this was just some repeat of any other murder story, I definitely would have rated this much lower.\n\nWith that being said, I can't really give this an outstanding rating because it doesn't bring anything new to the table for me. Simply put, it's a good movie; just not anything thing to be stoked about. In addition, I think the reason why my rating might appear harsh is because of the evolution of technology, and the fact that I watched this as a 19-year-old in 2021. These types of \"eluding capture\" movies from decades ago seem so far-fetched to me now, because of how good technology is nowadays. In today's day and age, it would be so much harder to elude capture for as long as Richard Kimble did in this story. And I know it's not this movie's fault, but it's just harder for me to go along with the story when I know how fictional this kind of thing would be today. For that reason, I think my review will be lower than an older audience, as the events of this movie would likely seem way more plausible without all of the tracking tech we have today.\n\nSo yeah, I did enjoy the execution of a classic style of a thriller, but my enjoyment really doesn't go much beyond enjoying seeing Harrison Ford in a classic movie.

Right off the bat, I think I'm going to like this one more than WandaVision. Obviously, the first episode was mostly exposition, which is why this is getting a lower rating since I really enjoy the intense action (which we got at the beginning of this episode). This episode had 3 main things going on. 1. the rise of a new anarchist group that wants the world to go back to the state during the 5-year blip period, named the Flag-Smashers. 2. Sam Wilson's family relations and financial issues. 3. Bucky adapting to being a normal 106-year-old civilian. During this first episode, Sam and Bucky actually don't ever end up meeting at all. I assume we're going to see a team-up soon, with the goal being to take down the Flag-Smashers, whose leader appears to be strength-enhanced in some way. We're also introduced to a new character, Torres, who is a member of the Army, but teams up with Sam at the beginning of the episode.\n\nThe one thing that's still up in the air is whether or not Steve Rogers is dead or not. We don't get an explicit answer from Sam Wilson, so I'm hoping this will be revealed down the line in a later episode. It was also really interesting seeing Bucky in the modern-world attempting to be normal, I doubt this will last long but it was fun to see. Another awesome thing that happened was a short appearance from Rhodey at the beginning of the episode. I hope he comes back for some more episodes.\n\nSo yeah, those are my thoughts on episode 1! I'm expecting this one to ramp up much faster than WandaVision, so I'd bet we're in for some good action in the next few episodes. @ me in the comments with your thoughts!

To start off, it may seem a little strange that I classified this one as romance & adventure, but I think that at its core it\'s a love story, with elements of adventure and sci-fi tied into it. A quick rundown down of the plot is as follows: a US Representative from New York is running for the US Senate and ends up losing the election when he meets a woman by the name of Elise in the venue where he delivers the concession speech. Throughout his journey in finding Elise again, David Norris realizes there are some mysterious figures in hats who claim to be controlling the events of the world and changing them according to the "plan" in their magic books. These are the members of The Adjustment Bureau. The "plan" dictates that David cannot be together with Elise, but as probably everyone who ever saw this movie ever predicted, they change it by getting the plan rewritten.\n\nThis is definitely kind of a strange movie. The concept of The Adjustment Bureau definitely seemed interesting, and the notions of fate vs. free will are deeply wrapped up in the storyline, so it is somewhat of a deep story. With that being said, I think The Adjustment Bureau had way too much of a religious backbone, as it was definitely insinuated that the "director" of The Adjustment Bureau is God and the "plan" that the members of The Adjustment Bureau are God\'s roadmap for humanity. I think this religious undertone makes this movie both predictable at times, and not very unique. Personally, I would have much preferred a more sci-fi-heavy version of this movie with a focus on technology rather than implying that The Adjustment Bureau is just God making sure the world happens according to his plan.\n\nI don\'t think this was an awful movie by any means because I think the elements of the love story were good, and Matt Damon and Emily Blunt each played great roles; I just think they could have done better on the whole Adjustment Bureau idea.\n\nSo yeah, those are my brief thoughts on this film, but as always, let me know your thoughts in the comments!',type:"movie",title:"The Adjustment Bureau",rating:64,timestamp:1616528259868,director:"George Nolfi",runtime:106,genre:"Romance/Adventure",mpaa:"PG-13",trailer:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H78XCiJamXc",releaseYear:2011,admin:0,poster:"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc0ZDcwZTYtOWUzZi00NDE4LWI4NjgtMWVjZTUyYTA2ZTNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_.jpg",likes:[1],id:44},{content:"Ok, so things really picked up here in episode 2, which I loved. I'm going to try to keep these reviews shorter, so here's a quick recap of everything important that happened. Sam and Bucky reunite here, and their dynamic is really funny to watch (they even went to couples counseling). There's a new Captain America, a dude named John Walker from the US military, and his friend, Lemar Hoskins aka Battlestar. Let's just say that new Cap and Lemar don't get off on the best terms with Sam and Bucky. After Sam and Bucky engage some members of the Flag Smashers, they realize that they are super-soldiers, which leads Bucky to tell Sam about this guy named Isaiah Bradley, who was a super soldier that Bucky fought in 1951, only Sam gets mad that Bucky didn't tell him or Steve that there were more super soldiers. And finally, at the end of the episode, Bucky and Sam head off to see Baron Zemo (yeah, the bad guy from Captain America: Civil War) in order to get information out of him about the super soldiers since he knew so much about Hydra (of course the episode ends right before anything happens though). So yeah, this was a good episode, and I'm excited to see where the story goes, especially with Zemo, as I always love to see reappearances of characters from previous MCU movies.

We're going to go through all of these in chronological order in the MCU timeline because we thought that would be more fun than just going chronological by release year. We thought that this one ranked in the middle of the pack; certainly not the worst, but certainly not the best. This one most appropriately fits into the category of origin story within Phase 1. I'll briefly address the plot, as at this point, I doubt I'm spoiling or ruining anything critical for anyone. \n\nSo this story follows Steve Rogers on his journey to becoming Captain America. I mentioned that this was the first one chronologically, and that's because it's actually set in the middle of WWII. Steve gets chosen to get a dose of serum from the lead Allies Scientist, and it instantly makes him grow close to a foot and put on like 80 pounds of muscle. Steve eventually goes over to Europe and goes head to head with Red Skull, the leader of the radical Nazi advanced science and weapons division named Hydra (more of them in a future review). Captain America leads a band of soldiers and they start beating up on Hydra all across Europe, taking out their weapons factories. On one of the missions, Cap's best friend Bucky Barnes falls out of a high-speed train in the Alps and falls to his death(?). I also forgot to mention that Steve falls in love with one of the heads of the Strategic Scientific Reserve, Peggy Carter. In the finale of the movie, Red Skull is attempting to go and bomb the entire US with a futuristic plane powered by a blue energy cube called the Tesseract (more on this important energy supply soon). Cap ends up defeating Red Skull, and Red Skull gets sucked into the Tesseract and vanishes. The futuristic plane is still carrying a bunch of warheads, so Cap has to put the plane down in the middle of nowhere to avoid people dying. Finally, we cut to the future where Cap awakens after being frozen in ice for 70 years because apparently this somehow kept him alive? It's a little questionable but it's all for a story so I'm ok with it. Director Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. greets Cap and lets him know that he's been frozen for 70 years. To recap where this movie leaves us, Captain America wakes up 70 years from his last memory, realizing that all the friends he once had were dead.\n\nThe thing with this movie is there's nothing that special to it other than a solid action film. That's why all 3 of us rated it lower than most other Marvel films. Especially when you compare it to another origin story film like Ironman, it's just not as interesting. What this movie did do was serve as most of the historical basis for the rest of the films, as the Strategic Scientific Reserve turns into S.H.I.E.L.D., we learn the origins of Hydra, we learn what the Tesseract is, and how Captain America is out of place in the future. The remaining films in the timeline build heavily on the Tesseract, S.H.I.E.L.D., and Hydra, so this was an important film in setting up the future of this universe. I just thought it was a little bit bland compared to some of the successors of this film.\n\nSo yeah, I'm not saying this movie was bad by any means, I just don't think it stands up to the likes of other stronger MCU films like Ironman, The Avengers, or Guardians of the Galaxy, etc. I know everyone has so many different opinions on Marvel movies, so make sure to comment on what you agree with. This was already mentioned in an announcement, but to reiterate, the Adameter for all Marvel movies is a simple unweighted average of @Trevor's, @brendanmwagner's, and my own ratings. We thought this would standardize all of the ratings. There are still 20+ more of these to come, so stay tuned in the coming weeks!

As for the release timeline, Captain Marvel sits at a unique spot. Just weeks before the finale of the Infinity Saga with Avengers: Endgame, Marvel puts out a prequel, taking us all the way back to the 90\u2019s, putting Captain Marvel at the second spot in the chronological timeline. The release of the film was necessary due to her becoming an \u2018essential\u2019 plot point in Endgame, but as a whole Captain Marvel feels trivial compared to the grand space epic that the Infinity Saga films have built up. As a standalone movie Captain Marvel tells an interesting story; in the context of the MCU, its scope is small and its character less empathetic, effectively giving us a narrative with no background or context other than a young Nick Fury and Agent Coulson. Being the second movie in the MCU timeline, it's clear why it has to be an 'introduction' type film, but we can't neglect that when putting it in a vacuum, the film simply doesn\u2019t grab you as much as others in the MCU, especially considering its arguably worst performance is the lead herself. \n\nCaptain Marvel serves as a prequel for the backstory of a few known and new characters. While Carol Danvers herself is the subject of the film, the actual substance that MCU fanatics care about will relate more to Nick Fury, Agent Coulson, the Tesseract, and the formation of the Avengers initiative. Action sequences involving Fury and Coulson, infused with comedic moments as usual, are some of the best parts of the movie. Additionally, the introduction of Maria and Monica Rambeau to the MCU set up for WandaVision and ensuing content coming from Marvel soon. The plot involving the Kree and the Skrulls is well done, albeit predictable, and thus the primary plot is slightly less captivating than the larger MCU-spanning storylines the audience cares about. Of course, the solo MCU movies are smaller in scope, but Captain Marvel feels especially meager. This is escalated by the performance of Brie Larson, which to put it best, feels forced and corny. Her character follows a similar archetype of \u2018a being not from Earth learning about what Earth is like\u2019, but the writers indulged the wrong parts of this trope and made her character fairly bland. While not necessarily a focal point of the movie, around its release there was positive buzz about Larson\u2019s performance as a lead woman in a superhero movie. But honestly, there is not much to write home about. If we\u2019re going to applaud a female performance in this genre, look at Gal Gadot in the first Wonder Woman, or look at Scarlett Johansson every time she plays Black Widow. Hell, even take the anti-hero performance of Margot Robbie in Suicide Squad or Birds of Prey. Those performances are great, and Larson simply does not perform on the same caliber. Regardless of whether that is due to her acting or just mediocre writing, we need to see better from her in future MCU films if we are to give her the same praise as the aforementioned actresses.\n\nWith a second movie in the works, I hope Marvel can produce a story more intriguing than the first. Captain Marvel was effectively just a prequel to the MCU that happened to introduce a character that would change the tide of battle in Endgame. In and of itself, it lacks the same satisfaction or punch that other titles from the universe have given. The feeling of watching it in comparison to the whole MCU is almost like watching a football game from a decade ago, whose outcome you already know, just a few days before the Superbowl happening in the present day. Yeah, it\u2019s cool to see some of the players back when they\u2019re younger, but you know only certain things can take place during the game since the end result is already known. The real event is the Superbowl, which you\u2019ve been waiting for all season and don\u2019t know how it will go down. By the time the Superbowl ends, you\u2019ve forgotten all about the game from the past. \n\nNext up in the MCU timeline review series is the original Iron Man, reviewed by @brendanmwagner.\n",type:"movie",director:"Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck",rating:68,title:"Captain Marvel",timestamp:1617480524949,runtime:124,genre:"Action/Sci-fi",mpaa:"PG-13",trailer:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1BCujX3pw8",releaseYear:2019,admin:5,poster:"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71K3S%2BTk4OL._AC_SL1303_.jpg",likes:[0],id:47},{content:"Ok so this was a really awesome episode.

We found out where the serum came from: a doctor who was working for HYDRA, and then got recruited by the mysterious Power Broker to recreate the serum. 2. Karli and the Flag Smashers stole the serum from the Power Broker, which is the Power Broker is chasing after them. The best part of this episode for me was seeing Baron Zemo again, who is a super underrated character, and I loved the whole breaking him out of prison bit.

We get to follow the story of Tony Stark (MIT represent!), a wealthy genius whose family business profits off of war by building weapons of mass destruction and selling them to the military.  Stark never really cared about that until he was almost killed by his own tech when he was kidnapped by the leader of the terrorist group.  The leader told Stark he could escape if he built the terrorists his newest weapon, but Stark knew he was lying.  With the help of Dr. Yinsen, he instead built a suit out of metal scraps he was given, and became Iron Man.  He broke out of the lab and escaped into the desert after Yinsen heroically sacrificed his life for Stark.  Once Stark got back home, he pledged that his company would no longer build weapons and would shift their focus to other things.  As you may assume, the rest of the owners of the company were not too happy with this and tried to circumvent him.  However, Stark was too busy trying to build a better Iron Man suit to really focus on that until it was too late.  The movie culminated in a big fight between Stark and Obadiah Stane, the other main owner of the company.  Stane had secured the technology of the early suit from the terrorist group and used it to build his own massive suit, which Stark was barely able to defeat.  \n\nThis movie set a high tone for the MCU and I really think that without this movie being as good as it was, the MCU would not be where it is today.  The first end-credit scene in MCU history features Nick Fury introducing Stark, and us, to the idea of a coalition of heroes called the Avengers.  This movie distinguishes itself from many of the other intro Marvel films with its use of humor to make the movie more relatable, which became a hallmark of the MCU.  The villain is complex and interesting and the main character himself develops throughout the film as he works to build the suit not for personal gain but to protect others.  When Stark reveals himself, he uses the iconic line, \u201cI am Iron Man.\u201d which makes a reappearance in Avengers: Endgame, making for a fun callback that does a great job of tying together the beginning and end of the original wave of heroes.  This film performed very well commercially and showed that there was a large audience for this kind of movie, encouraging Marvel to continue to expand the universe, with Tony Stark becoming many people\u2019s favorite superhero.\n\nNext up in the MCU review series is Iron Man 2, which will also be reviewed by me.\n",type:"movie",director:"Jon Favreau",rating:85,title:"Iron Man",timestamp:1617645262263,runtime:126,genre:"Action/Adventure",mpaa:"PG-13",trailer:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugaeA-nMTc",releaseYear:2008,admin:9,poster:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/00/Iron_Man_poster.jpg",likes:[0,9],id:49},{content:"So getting right into it, this episode was pretty crazy, and probably the most action packed one yet.

Robert Downey Jr. returns as Tony Stark, but this time, everyone knows that he is really Iron Man.  Near the beginning of the film, we see Ivan Vanko, the disgruntled son of the scientist who helped Howard Stark build the arc reactor, come to take revenge on Stark for his father\u2019s lack of recognition for his work.  This comes while Stark is driving in the Monaco Grand Prix, and he is barely able to escape until he retrieves the Iron Man suit.  In the aftermath of the first movie, everyone in the world saw the potential for a powered suit and as a result, lots of hostile organizations tried to replicate it.  However, no one is successful until two different things fall into the lap of Justin Hammer, the CEO of a rival company.  First, Rhodey takes one of Stark\u2019s suits to the government after Stark has a drunken party which ends with the two of them fighting.  Hammer is hired to outfit the suit by the government.  Hammer also breaks Vanko out of prison to help him build his army of drones.  However, while Hammer is demonstrating his tech at the Stark Expo, Vanko takes over and tries to attack Stark.  After Stark and Rhodey, who have reconciled, destroy all of the drones, Vanko himself shows up and the two of them beat him as well.  This movie also sees the introduction of Black Widow, who has several of the impressive hand-to-hand combat moments which will become her hallmark.\n\n\tWhile this was still a very enjoyable film, it failed to live up to the highs of the first film.  Since this one doesn\u2019t need to go into any of the backstory that the first one needed to cover, you would think that there would be a more complete and full plot.  However, the first one still has a better villain and conflict, while the sequel often seems predictable and rushed.  Another conflict which arises, Stark\u2019s blood toxicity rising from his chest implant, is rather lazily solved and is pretty unrelated to the rest of the movie.  I really enjoyed this film, but it is hard to not compare it to the first movie.  There are plenty of good things about Iron Man 2, such as the further development of such characters as Pepper Potts and Rhodey, both of whom become much more important to the MCU, especially Rhodey as War Machine.  We get to meet Phil Coulson and Nick Fury and learn about the Avenger Initiative.  There are plenty of the Iron Man one liners that make him such a fun character, and the action scenes are very fun to watch.  Overall, I think this movie is overhated by many Marvel fans simply because it doesn\u2019t quite live up to its potential.\n\nNext up in the Marvel series is Thor, reviewed by the illustrious @BulkyEndymion38.\n",type:"movie",title:"Iron Man 2",rating:81,timestamp:1618238732587,director:"Jon Favreau",runtime:124,genre:"Action/Adventure",mpaa:"PG-13",trailer:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoohRoVA9WQ",releaseYear:2010,admin:9,poster:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-t1PuJt9W2V8/U_t1sbpWhAI/AAAAAAAADrY/x8EaVEKeeZQ/s1600/Iron_Man_2_Poster.jpg",likes:[0,9],id:51},{content:"@Trevor: 70%\n@brendanmwagner: 69%\nMe: 68%\n\nOk, so we've arrived at our first Thor movie! For this one, we all were very close to the same score, averaging out at 69%. I'll get right into a super quick summary of the movie. Thor is about to become King of Asgard, but after a rash and unauthorized attack by Thor, his father Odin, the current King of Asgard (played by Anthony Hopkins aka Dr. Lecter), banishes him to earth to learn how to be \"worthy\" of his power. While on earth, Thor meets Jane Foster, an astrophysicist, who helps him on his journey to find his hammer and return to Asgard. Thor's older brother Loki is super jealous that Thor is getting the throne, so we realize that it was his plan all along to get Thor banished so Loki could take his father's place as King. Loki tries to kill Thor, but in doing so, Thor becomes \"worthy\" by protecting the people of earth from Loki's giant robot, meaning Thor got his powers back and could return to Asgard.\n\nSo I should mention that I saw The Avengers before I saw Thor, and it's so funny to me how different both Loki and Thor are in Thor. What I mean by that is both of them seem so much more childish, and even though the main point of Thor was Thor actually maturing a ton, he's basically a different person at the beginning of this movie versus when he appears in The Avengers. Same with Loki, he just seemed so much more \"evil\" to me in The Avenger than in Thor. I should also mention that I'm not the biggest Thor fan, I just don't think he's all that interesting of a character to me. The only time I've really enjoyed Thor is in Thor: Ragnarok, but I think that's mostly due to Taika Waititi's incredible directing in that film. While we're on the topic of directing, I had no idea that the director of Thor was Kenneth Branagh, whom you may know as Andrei Sator, the villain from Tenet, or Commander Bolton from Dunkirk (yup, I love making even the smallest connection to Nolan films).\n\nSo yeah, this wasn't a terrible movie or anything, I just don't find the Asgardian fantasy element all that interesting. If I had to pick the best thing about this film, it would be Loki. This was Loki's birth into the MCU, and he is such an interesting character to me. I think part of it is that Tom Hiddleston is a much better actor than Chris Hemsworth in my opinion, but Loki's mischief and tricks are always very amusing to watch, which is why I'm super excited to watch the new Disney+ show Loki, which releases in about 2 months (which I will be going week by week on). \n\nNext up in the Marvel Series is The Avengers, review by @Trevor!",type:"movie",title:"Thor",rating:69,timestamp:1618402379661,director:"Kenneth Branagh",runtime:115,genre:"Action/Sci-fi",mpaa:"PG-13",trailer:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOddp-nlNvQ",releaseYear:2011,admin:0,poster:"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGE4NzU1YTAtNzA3Mi00ZTA2LTg2YmYtMDJmMThiMjlkYjg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTgzMDMzMTg@._V1_.jpg",likes:[9],id:52},{content:"This movie was definitely one of the most interesting films I've seen in the last few months. It's been on Netflix for a little while now, so I thought I'd give it a try considering it's Scorsese + DiCaprio. Similar to The Silence of The Lambs, I'd definitely throw this movie into the Psychological Thriller category. I can't really go into the plot very deeply at all, because that would ruin so much of the film because that's just the way this movie works.\n\nTo start off, we're dropped right into a scene with US Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck. They're en route to Shutter Island, which is located in Massachusetts and houses a mental hospital. They were called there to investigate the mysterious disappearance of inmate Rachel Solando, who vanished mysteriously from her cell. Soon after, we realize that Teddy is a classic example of an unreliable narrator, as he experiences frequent hallucinations and visions. Teddy and Chuck soon expand the investigation to try and figure out some of the mysteries hidden behind the scenes as Shutter Island, which is what the majority of the film revolves around.\n\nThat summary was super general, but the best part of the movie was certain reveals in the plot, so I really don't want to give much of that away. So this movie has a 2h19m runtime, and I'd say up until maybe 1h30m, I would have rated this movie in the 60% range, but the second half of the movie was so good, that it bumped up the score dramatically. I was so confused about what the heck was happening in the first part, and felt myself wondering, what even is the point of this story; where is it going? But I can surely say that the confusion of the first half is needed to make the second half as strong of an ending as it was. I absolutely love movies with big reveals, realizations, and twists. I've mentioned it in a few other reviews, but it makes the movie so much more interesting when your mind gets blown by new details you sort of did/didn't see coming.\n\nThe only reason why I didn't rate this one higher is it's such a weird and strange film to me (well mainly the first half, but definitely overall as well). During the first half, I was a little bit bored and sometimes question what I was watching. Now that I think about it, I felt a very similar feeling when I watched Taxi Driver for the first time, which is another Scorsese film from 1976. In both Shutter Island and Taxi Driver, there were so many moments where I was like what the heck am I watching right now. Don't get me wrong, they're both different films, but I definitely remember feeling very confused and weirded out in a similar manner.\n\nIn terms of where this stacks up with other Scorsese films, definitely not my favorite of his work, as I enjoyed The Departed and The Irishman a lot more. I get that these two crime films are drastically different from Shutter Island, but I can confidently say they're way better films overall.\n\nSo yeah, those are my thoughts on this strange thriller, but make sure to leave your own thoughts in the comments below!",type:"movie",title:"Shutter Island",rating:75,timestamp:1618576894153,director:"Martin Scorsese",runtime:139,genre:"Mystery/Thriller",mpaa:"R",trailer:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iaYLCiq5RM",releaseYear:2010,admin:0,poster:"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8187AUOt+iL._RI_.jpg",likes:[9],id:53},{content:"The second-to-last episode of The Falcon and The Winter Soldier was much more chill than episode 4.

Let's go through and tackle each one of these things. Walker gets stripped of his Captain America duties, but is then approached by a mysterious woman named Contessa Valentina Allegra de la Fontaine (that's a mouthful) approaches Walker and lets him know she'll be in touch, so we'll have to see where this leads us. The GRC has been stepping up its efforts to find and bring the Flag Smashers to justice, so Karli and her gang head to New York, where the GRC is about to conduct a big vote. And finally, the majority of the episode focuses on Sam Wilson, who goes to Isaiah for answers on his past and spends a lot of the episode rebuilding his parents' boat with Bucky. The coolest part of the episode undoubtedly comes when Sam starts training with the shield, indicating that he will be the one to step into the new Captain America role (either officially or unofficially), and the episode leaves us on a cliffhanger by showing Sam opening a case from Wakanda (presumably) with his new falcon gear.\n\nSo yeah, there's only one episode left, so I'm really interested to see if all this gets wrapped up, or if we're not going to get a resolution to all the plot in this show.

In the first few minutes, we get the big reveal of what we've been waiting for all season long: Sam's Captain America suit. This whole mini-series was basically a way to show Falcon's transition into Captain America, fulfilling the final scene from Avengers: Endgame when Steve Rogers passes the torch to him. Sam's Captain America is way cooler than Steve Rogers' Captain America in my opinion, and Sam's suit is way cooler than Steve's ever was, sporting the same Falcon wings, along with a new shield holder in back, and of course the red, white, and blue color scheme. We had a big clash between Karli's forces and the team of Bucky, Captain America, and Sharon Carter. To add more to this already chaotic fight, John Walker show up with his homemade Walmart shield, out for revenge on Karli. Eventually, Karli manages to escape into the sewers, with Bucky, Cap, and Walker chasing after her and her super soldier friends. She eventually runs into Sharon Carter, who we find out is the mysterious Power Broker from a few episodes back, but this wasn't really a surprise to me.\n\nKarli ends up shooting Sharon when Cap arrives, and Karli and Cap fight until Sharon gets back up and shoots Karli dead. This was definitely easy to see coming since Sharon needed to protect her identity as the Power Broker. In the last little bit, we see Walker in his new suit as the U.S. Agent from the comics, and Sharon getting pardoned, which should lead to some trouble down the road since she's now an arms dealer.\n\nSo yeah, this episode and series certainly weren't bad, but I'm just not really sure what it accomplished other than the transformation of Falcon into Captain America.

It's because I had never watched this movie until yesterday, so I want to review it while I'm fresh off seeing it, which is why I'm reviewing this before Patriot Games. So rolling right into it, this is a super typical Harrison Ford action movie, so you're getting exactly what you're expecting if you've seen some other things like Patriot Games, The Fugitive, or Air Force One. Whereas Patriot Games, the predecessor of Clear and Present Danger involves Jack Ryan protecting his family from an Irish terrorist group out for revenge, Clear and Present Danger focuses much more on the national level, and on the wrongdoings of the US government in relation to the Colombian drug cartels.\n\nTo give a super quick overview summary, Jack Ryan becomes the acting Director of the CIA when his dear friend and mentor Admiral Greer is diagnosed with terminal cancer. When an American businessman and friend of the President is murdered by a Colombian cartel, a secret off-the-books strike team is sent to Colombia to kill the heads of the drug cartels in revenge. However, things aren't that simple, as Jack Ryan starts to discover ties between the businessman and the cartels, so he starts trying to uncover what's really happening. To make matters more confusing for Ryan, one of the cartel's intelligence officers is attempting to overthrow the head of the cartel, leading to more secret deals and back-stabbings.\n\nThe thing I really liked about this movie was how the viewer was discovering and finding out new facts along with Ryan, which is genius because it makes the plot much more interesting since we feel like we're in his shoes and can relate to all of his thoughts and feelings. This element of mystery of not knowing what's next made for a very interesting film for me. I think that's one of the biggest differences between Clear and Present Danger and Patriot Games since Patriot Games don't really have the same mysterious aspect. With that being said, I do prefer Patriot Games simply because I think the intensity is higher than Clear and Present Danger since the story is filled with more passion and anger given that it revolves around a personal vendetta. Other than that, there's nothing super unique or special about this movie: it's simply a solid action movie that I enjoyed watching.\n\nSo yeah, those are my thoughts on the second Harrison Ford Jack Ryan movie.

It may not be apparent yet since I haven't done any Star Wars reviews yet, but it's undoubtedly my favorite film franchise of all time. Star Wars is what I grew up on; Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and Star Wars Legos themselves were all staples for fun for me (and still are to this day). Unlike most other reviews, I'm not going to give much of a summary at all, but rather spend time talking about why this is such a good film.\n\nThe Story: A New Hope follows a classic example of a story called the monomyth, or the hero's journey. You can look that up if you don't know what it is, but basically, it's a very traditional way of telling a story, and a method employed by a ton of other movies and books (Harry Potter, and The Lord of the Rings to name a couple). One might argue that it's not a very creative way of telling a story, but I think having a simple delivery of the story works very well for Star Wars, considering the creativity comes from the sci-fi nature of the film.\n\nThe Imagination: We have to take a minute to appreciate just how incredible and innovative this movie was for 1970s sci-fi. This truly was the most revolutionary movie for sci-fi ever created. Not only did George Lucas have the imagination to come up with the extraordinary details, but the execution to make them come to life. I mean think of how many things are unique to this movie: the conflict between the Rebellion and the Empire, the entirely new planet system (Tatooine, Dantooine, Alderaan, and the moon Yavin IV were among the ones mentioned in A New Hope), the tech and weaponry (the stormtroopers' E-11s, the rebels' DH-17s, Han Solo's DL-44, the Death Star, TIE Fighters, TIE Interceptors, TIE Advanced, X-Wings, Y-Wings, The Millenium Falcon I could go on and on and on about all the super-specific and detailed ships and weapons and tech introduced just in this first movie). It's also crazy how elaborate and drawn out the universe was even from the very start! Ben Kenobi mentions the Clone Wars in the first 40 minutes of the movie! This is something that would later be covered by 2 entire movies (Episode II and III), and a 7-season TV show, and somehow George Lucas was able to come up with it all the way back in 1977. I mentioned earlier how good the execution of this creativity was, and I really mean it. One of the things this movie does best really making the audience feel like this really was filmed in a galaxy far far away. An example I love is in the very opening shot of the film, with Vader's Star Destroyer in hot pursuit of Leia's Tantive IV. This shot looks so real, like both of them are absolutely massive spaceships in real life. It's nearly impossible to tell that George Lucas actually filmed this shot with small-scale models of both ships. I also love this shot after watching Rogue One, because we know have a backstory to this conflict that we were previously thrown into without knowing, but now we know that both ships just jumped out of hyperspace, both having left the airspace above Scarif.\n\nThe Score: Finally, this movie got its own original score, and it just so happens to be one of the most famous movie soundtracks in history, composed by the legendary John Williams. I mean so much of the beauty of Star Wars comes from the fusion of its story with the music. I mean imagine Darth Vader without his own menacing theme. Imagine Luke staring into the two suns on Tatooine without the swells of Binary Sunset playing. It just adds so much character to this already amazing film.\n\nSo yeah, those are my super quick thoughts on this film, and why I think it truly is one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. I mean this is more than just a film, it's its own universe, beloved by people across the world. As I mentioned before, there are so many things I missed in this review. I simply don't have the time to detail all of my thoughts on this movie because I have so many of them.

I just finished watching it today, so this will all be with a fresh perspective. Pulp Fiction is a classic Tarantino film, told with a non-linear timeline, from multiple points of view. The main characters are hitmen Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, who work for a crime boss named Marsellus Wallace, and we follow them through a very very messy day at work let's say. We also have another separate but highly intertwined storyline going on that follows Butch Coolidge, a boxer who was just paid off by Marsellus to throw a fight. The other main player in this film is Mia Wallace, Marsellus's wife who Vincent has to take care of one night when things don't go according to plan let's just say. I won't go too much into detail in the plot because you really have to see the movie to understand all of it.\n\nWhat's good about this movie? First off, this film has so many notable hilarious quotes, including one which I consider to be quite possibly the funniest movie quote I've heard, \"Oh man, I...,\" and I won't finish the rest of the quote because it would ruin the entire scene. Secondly, I absolutely love non-linear and non-chronological storylines. Especially ones that start and end at the same time chronologically, and Pulp Fiction both starts and ends at the same diner scene from two perspectives, which I absolutely loved. Finally, the characters are super interesting, and they all have a depth to them that we explore throughout the film.\n\nThere's not much that I don't like about this film, but if I had to pick the biggest reason why I gave this an 82% instead of a 92%, it's most definitely because of how over-the-top extreme some of the scenes were, especially with all the drugs and such. I personally prefer a heavier emphasis on the action, which is why this film is falling below most other Tarantinos in my own opinion. Don't get me wrong, this is still a super interesting film, and I'm glad I watched it, but unlike Kill Bill or Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood, I'm not dying to watch this again anytime soon.\n\nSo where does this stack up against the other Tarantinos? I have a few other Tarantinos posted on the site already, but I can also compare it to the ones I've already seen but have yet to review. I definitely like this one better than Reservoir Dogs and The Hateful Eight, but it definitely falls short of Kill Bill: Volume 1, Kill Bill: Volume 2, Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood, and Inglorious Basterds. The jury's still out on which is better between this film and Django Unchained.\n\nSo yeah, those are my brief thoughts on this classic Tarantino film.

One interesting thing about these movies for me is I think they get significantly better over time, as the 4th and 5th happened to be my first and second favorites in this long franchise of films.\n\nHere's a super quick overview of the plot: the protagonist Ethan Hunt is a secret agent with the Impossible Missions Force (IMF), tasked with securing the CIA's NOC list, which is basically a list of undercover agents and their locations when a mission goes wrong and Ethan is suspected of being a mole. Ethan then has to save the NOC list and prove his innocence to the US government.\n\nSo what do I like and dislike about this movie? Here are the main pros for me: the score, the tech, and the action. While the score may not be the best of any movie, I think it still does a great job of providing suspense when needed, and of course, it created the classic Mission: Impossible theme song that most people know today. As most of you know by now, action thrillers are some of my absolute favorites, so it's no surprise that I loved the tech and action in this film. There are many puzzles and mysteries that the audience is able to solve along with Ethan Hunt, which makes the film so interesting to watch. Also, some of the imaginative fake technologies in these movies are awesome, most notably the thin rubber face masks worn by the agents to perfectly impersonate anyone they choose.\n\nThe main weaknesses I see with this movie are the plot and the characters. I'm not saying the plot is terrible and uninteresting, but it just seems super messy to me. To anyone who has seen this movie, think of how many reveals, switches, and generally confusing moments happen in the first 40ish minutes in Prague; there's a lot of them! I know that this movie needed to be somewhat confusing so as to not reveal the plot twist in the end, but it definitely could have been more concise and organized than it ended up being. Also, the characters aren't anything to write home about. I really don't see any depth behind Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt other than he's a secret agent, and there's nothing more to him.\n\nSo yeah, those are my main thoughts on MI1 on its 25th anniversary. At some point, I'll be getting around to reviewing all of the rest of the films when I have time, but it might be a while.",type:"movie",title:"Mission: Impossible",rating:71,timestamp:1621684306242,director:"Brian De Palma",runtime:110,genre:"Action/Thriller",mpaa:"PG-13",trailer:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ohws8y572KE",releaseYear:1996,admin:0,poster:"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/30/8b/ed/308bed2b989f6179bbb35eca8d278705.jpg",likes:[],id:59},{content:"Today is June 12th, 2021, meaning Raiders of The Lost Ark, aka Indiana Jones 1, aka Raiders was released exactly 40 years ago today! We'll be diving into a super brief look at one of my favorite adventure films on its 40th birthday. This review is going to sound very similar to the Star Wars review, as it should since both of these franchises were my favorites when I was younger. In fact, Lego Indiana Jones was the first game I got for my Nintendo DS Lite. Anyways, I'm going to break down this one in a similar fashion, dividing it into 3 main categories.\n\nThe characters: While I don't think Harrison Ford is one of the most talented actors ever, I think Indiana Jones is his best character. He's intelligent, cocky, charismatic, and daring, so practically everything anyone would want in an action hero. Supporting him is Marion Ravenwood, who helps Indy along his adventure, fulfilling the sidekick role of the hero's journey/monomyth that I talked about during Star Wars. Finally, Belloq is the perfect adversary for Indy, as he sports many of the same personality traits that Indy does, with the addition of greed which eventually led to his demise. These core characters lead to an incredible adventure.\n\nThe score: There's not much to say here; it's the Williams & Spielberg duo back at it again, so the score perfectly suits the film, providing suspense when needed, and otherwise delivering a general sense of \"adventure\" if that makes any sense. If you haven't heard this soundtrack, you definitely have, you just didn't know it was from this movie.\n\nThe adventure: This is by far the best element of this movie in my opinion. The rich adventure aspect this movie delivers is unparalleled. The amount of lore and mystery that Spielberg chooses to surround the ark with builds so much excitement in the audience. In addition, the film travels to so many distinct locations, for example, the South American jungle and Cairo.\n\nSo yeah, those are my brief and quick thoughts on Raiders on its 40th anniversary. I quickly wanted to mention the ending of the film also, which was awesome. The ending of the film shows US government workers sealing up the ark in a wooden crate, and wheeling it into an enormous warehouse with thousands of identical-looking crates presumably containing similarly dangerous items. This uncertain note to end on was so cool to see.

Not going to lie, this movie was exactly what I expected it to be from the trailers: a pure action movie (with no superhero tricks or gimmicks) focusing on unraveling the mystery behind Natasha Romanoff's past. There's nothing super special about this movie, but it delivers the same consistent quality that Marvel has been producing for years. In terms of other Marvel movies, it's definitely middle of the pack. It wasn't anything extraordinary, but it definitely was a high-quality movie that made for an excellent theater-going experience for me. I'm not going to reveal anything about the plot of this movie, especially since this is my first review on a movie's opening weekend!\n\nWhat I will share are some things that I found really cool, that can be seen or reasonably inferred from the many trailers released around this film. 1. Taskmaster was finally introduced into the MCU! My knowledge on Taskmaster is pretty limited to some of the animated Marvel TV shows from the 2000s, but I was happy to see the similarities, specifically the fighting technique copying ability. 2. This film is set in 2016 (think right after the conclusion of Captain America: Civil War). Clearly the movie was set in the past after Natasha's fate in Avengers: Endgame, but this answers the question of exactly when it takes place. 3. The post-credits scene contained the first massive link to a Disney+ show, specifically The Falcon and The Winter Soldier. This is a really interesting and sneaky marketing tactic to push Disney+ onto the audience.\n\nLet's talk about new characters! Almost every single character in this film was new, so I just wanna highlight my favorites. The two main supporting characters, Yelena and (Alexei aka Red Guardian) were definitely my favorite characters in the entire film. From the trailer, I already knew Red Guardian was going to be really funny, and he definitely lived up to it, delivering a lot of laughs in an otherwise super serious movie. What I didn't see coming from the trailer was how hilarious Yelena was. She was without a doubt my favorite character from the movie, specifically one of my favorite lines came when she started mocking Natasha's fighting poses.\n\nSo yeah, those are my thoughts on this new release! I hope everyone who goes to see it enjoys being back in the theaters for a Marvel Movie. Hopefully, someday I'll get around to finishing those other Marvel Reviews when I have the time.

Loki's production quality felt insanely close to the kind of quality we're used to for full-scale Marvel movies.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of Loki without spoiling anything big. The events of the story take place over 6 episodes, similar to The Falcon and The Winter Soldier. We pick up right where we left off last time we saw Loki in the MCU in Avengers: Endgame: when Iron Man and Captain America traveled back in time to the Battle of New York in 2012 to steal the Tesseract, but it goes wrong and Loki (who was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D.) picks it up and uses it to escape. After teleporting, Loki lands in the Gobi Desert, where he is picked up and arrested by the TVA (Time Variance Authority). Basically, this is a secret police force who live beyond time itself, and are charged with protecting the timeline from any variations (i.e. Loki escaping from New York). Eventually, a TVA agent named Mobius saves Loki from being erased from existence by finding a use for him: tracking down a variant of himself. To explain what a variant is, it's a different version of oneself in a parallel universe. \n\nRight from the getgo of Loki, it was clear this is where the multiverse would be introduced to the MCU, which is awesome because it allows for the possibility of seeing all 3 Spidermen in the upcoming Spiderman this December. Anyways, through the help of the variant Loki, Loki realizes something is up with the TVA, leading to an enormous quest to take down the TVA and figure out who is actually responsible for destroying these alternate realities. That was a super basic summary, but I don't want to give too much away in the case for some weird reason someone is reading this without having seen Loki.\n\nI just need to emphasize right now how much I loved this show. As I mentioned from the start of this review, Loki is undoubtedly the best MCU TV show released to Disney+. There are many reasons why I think this is true. 1. In my opinion, Tom Hiddleston knows how to act better than any other MCU actor. When he plays Loki he IS Loki; that's just how good he is. 2. All the new characters were amazing additions to the MCU. Every single character in this show besides Loki was new, and all of these new characters were winners, specifically Sylvie, Mobius, Classic Loki, and a man whose name rhymes with Zang. 3. The level of danger/peril was taken to a whole new level. Over the course of the MCU, we've experienced massive escalation with the scope of bad guys. Ironman 1's bad guy was a normal guy in a subpar mech suit. Avengers 1's bad guy was just Loki. And then we reach Thanos who wiped out half the universe. Loki reaches a step above that, dealing with a (sort of villain) who controls the flow of time itself, so we can see how this is a more powerful figure than even Thanos, which makes this such an exciting show knowing how hard it will be to defeat such a villain in the future.\n\nSo yeah, those are my thoughts on the best Marvel Show of the year!
